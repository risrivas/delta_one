# History of money
###################
6000 BC = Barter
700 BC = Gold
618-907 AD = Paper Bills
1879 AD = Gold Standard
1944 AD = Bretton Woods
1971 AD = End of Gold Standard


## Barter and Gold
- Barter system: exchange goods
for ex: a farmer has apples to sell and he wants to get clothes in return
basic flaw: to exchange apples with someone selling clothes => what if cloth seller do not want to buy apples in exchange of clothes

=> need for a common unit of exchange
this unit needs to:
- be used as a medium of exchange
- store value
- be a unit of value

Unit has to be:
- scarce
- hard to harvest
- durable

=> Gold was used in 700 BC to be that unit


## Paper money / Paper Bills
- Problems with Gold
can be debased - melt it, change it and create multiple sized coins
fluctuates based on supply (ex: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Gold_Rush)
hard to transport
issues with having multiple denominations
limited supply

- Paper Money
first used by the Chinese (619-907)
Eurpoeans started using only in 17th century
paper money was just an IOU (I Owe You)
IOU are exchanged at local banks

- IOU
people go to a local bank - deposit their gold - get IOU (paper) in return
now they can use this IOU to purchase in the market

- Fractional Reserve Banking
the gold deposited can be rented out or given as loan to earn interest by the banks
same happens today also - amount deposited in bank accounts - banks use that for own banking purpose

issue:
- if 50% of the gold coins are loaned out and all the people who deposited come back and ask for their gold coin
- bank is defaulted as it does not have 50% of gold

- Central Banks
first bank - Bank of England - 1694
Central Bank Notes valued better than other bank notes
Regulation for no new banks to print bank notes and closed local banks to remove their notes from circulation
This leaves the central bank's notes as the only ones in the country


## Gold Standard
- The Gold Standard is a system that backs it's currency with gold
- US adopted the system and one ounce of gold could be traded for $20.67
- This limits the governments and banks to excessively issue paper currency (and cause huge inflation),
  since the currency has to be backed by gold


## Bretton Woods
- change in the Gold Standard
After world war 1 (1914) and the great depression (1929)
In 1930s the UK abd the US stopped redeeming Cash (done under Roosevelt) for gold coins
Main reason: not enough gold to back the amount of currency they wanted (wanting to increase the money supply)
What tool replace? FIAT currency: "a term to describe currency that is used because of a government's order"
At this point the dollar was "floating"

- issue
suppose China prints lot of yuan currency and devaluates it as compared to US dollars
now as dollars has much more value in China as its much stronger than yuan - China can easily boost its exports
because many US people will start buying China goods as its cheaper for them

- Bretton Woods agreement
Cause: fear of countries devaluating their currencies (to boost exports)
In 1944, 44 countries meet in Bretton Woods, New Hampshire
Decision: all currencies linked to the US Dollar and the dollar linked to Gold
(as US had most amount of Gold that time in the world)

- creation of IMF (International Monetary Fund): IMF will lend money to countries in need
- creation of the World Bank: to help under-developed countries to grow


## End of the Gold Standard
- on 15-Aug-1971, US President Nixon declared that USD is not going to give back gold to other countries
reason: US printed so many USD that it was not as worth as actual gold they had
meaning, gold had much more value than USD and thus USD should be delinked from gold


## Money functions
- medium of exchange
- store of value
- unit of value

- should be scarce (cryptocurrency are scarce)
- durable

- problem with cryptocurrency is that its not unit of value
as it price fluctuates every moment

# Forex Market & Quotation
############################

# How to make money
example:
- Suppose you are living in US and go to Mexico for vacation for 5 days
- at airport, you convert $100 to 2000 pesos (1 USD -> 20 pesos)
- if you still have 2000 pesos while returning, and pesos strengthens its value (1 USD -> 16 pesos)
- then USD to get back is 2000 / 16 = 125 USD
- profit = 25 USD

# Currency Pairs
- Currency Pair: quoting one currency against another
- Base Currency: the first currency listed
- Quote Currency: the second currency listed
- Each currency is identified by its ISO Currency code
- ISO stands for International Organization for Standardization - code is 3 letter alphabetic code
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217

- example: Currency Pair USDCAD = 1.35
USD is base currency
CAD is quote currency

this is the Quote for the USD against Canadian dollar
=> means, 1 USD can be changed for 1.35 CAD


# Major Pairs and Cross Pairs
- based on liquiidity, major currencies:
USD
EUR
JPY
GBP
AUD
CAD
CHF

- major pairs
GBP/USD (the cable)
USD/CAD (Loonie)
AUD/USD (Aussie)
USD/CHF (Swissy)
USD/JPY
EUR/USD
NZD/USD

- there is a rule that which currency gets priority to be the base currency:
EUR
GBP
AUD
NZD
USD
CAD
CHF
JPY

- pairs that do not include USD => called as Cross Pairs
example: CAD/JPY


# Market Structure
- Transactions are done OTC (over the counter)
- there is no cnetral exchange to trade on
- because its OTC, execution prices will vary

- The interbank market is where banks exchange currencies with one another
- they can do this by transacting directly through EBS (Electronic Broking Services)
or Thompson Reuters who are the two electronic brokering platforms at this level
- this is only available to very large banks - like JP Morgan, HSBC, GS, MS, ML, DB, UBS, etc

- the players:
FX Dealers (large banks)
Other Large Participants (hedge funds, etc)
forex brokers and retail ECNs
