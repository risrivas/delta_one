# History of money
###################
6000 BC = Barter
700 BC = Gold
618-907 AD = Paper Bills
1879 AD = Gold Standard
1944 AD = Bretton Woods
1971 AD = End of Gold Standard


## Barter and Gold
- Barter system: exchange goods
for ex: a farmer has apples to sell and he wants to get clothes in return
basic flaw: to exchange apples with someone selling clothes => what if cloth seller do not want to buy apples in exchange of clothes

=> need for a common unit of exchange
this unit needs to:
- be used as a medium of exchange
- store value
- be a unit of value

Unit has to be:
- scarce
- hard to harvest
- durable

=> Gold was used in 700 BC to be that unit
