# Introduction
################
# A relevant hedge example would be the purchase of a basket of stocks that are expect to "outperform" their associated index
  and the sale of the index future;
  the converse case is the short sale of "underperforming" stocks (or the sale of their "single stock" futures)
  and the purchase of the index futures

# How Knowledge of Index Arbitrage Can Assist Investment Timing
- Knowledge of the price of an index future and its associated "spot" index relative to each other can be
  indicative of future index arbitrage program trading activity
- Even if the future-spot index difference indicates a program trade would be profitable for arbitrageurs,
  there is no certainty that it would be executed; nevertheless, it would be indicative of the current market bias
- If you are a long term investor whose investment horizon exceeds one year, you can ignore index arbitrage conditions
  because the attendant long term market and economic factors will be greater determinants of your investment success or failure

# Instruments used:
- Stocks
- Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
such as SPDR (Spiders), QQQ (Cubes), or DIA (Diamonds)
- Index futures
such as the S&P 500, NASDAQ 100, or Dow Jones Ind. Avg.
or the e-mini or mini versions of these
- Options on stocks or indexes

# IndexArb Terms Description
#############################
# What are Fair Value, Sell Active, Sell Threshold, Buy Threshold, and Buy Active?
# When do sell programs and buy programs occur?

- Index arbitrage is a form of program trading activity that can produce sudden and possibly sharp market movements

- Investors could benefit from knowing the conditions under which program trades might occur by either avoiding trades
  in the opposite direction or taking trades in the same direction
example:
if conditions indicate that a "sell" program is imminent or about to happen,
an investor might wish to defer a stock or call option purchase until the futures and equities markets have returned to equilibrium
and the sell program conditions no longer exist

Conversely,
if buy program conditions exist,
an investor could proceed to execute a stock or call option purchase and possibly benefit from a rising market caused by the buy program

# There are two types of index arbitrage programs: sell and buy
- "Buy programs" occur when the futures market is over-valued relative to the stock market
and consists of the index futures being sold and the stocks in the index being bought => most common scenario in banks

- "Sell programs", the opposite case, occur when the futures market is under-valued relative to the stock market
and consists of the index futures being bought and the stocks in the index being sold.

- Over-valued and under-valued conditions arise because trading in the futures and equities markets occurs independently


# Premium / Basis / Spread
Index arbitrage program trades are triggered
when the arithmetic difference between an index's futures contract price and the index's spot (or current) price reaches an over or under-valued extreme
This arithmetic difference is known by the various names of premium, basis or spread

- example:
calculation of premium:
if the S&P 500 futures contract price is 1409 and the S&P 500 spot index is 1400, the premium is 9

- Whether this particular premium has bearish or bullish implications depends on whether it falls in the range of sell programs, no programs, or buy programs
- These program ranges are delineated by the five premium values of sell active, sell threshold, fair value, buy threshold, and buy active,
- These five significant values are mathematically determined; an equation for "fair value"

NOTE: details on "Futures Fair value" is provided later


################
# Sell Programs
################
- A sell program is the simultaneous (short) sell of all (or almost all) the stocks in the index (in weighted proportions)
and the purchase of the index's futures contract
- If the sell program is of sufficient magnitude, the stocks comprising the index will decline and,
correspondingly, the index's futures contract will rise, producing the effect of a stock market decline and a futures market rise

- A sell program condition arises when the "futures - spot" premium shrinks significantly below fair value

- This can happen because the futures and equity markets move independently and,
in this case, either the futures contract has moved sufficiently lower
and/or the spot index has moved sufficiently higher, relative to each other
=> The spot index moves higher when one or more stocks in the index increases

- If the resulting, shrunken premium reaches the sell threshold,
an index arbitrageur can capture a riskfree profit by executing a sell program

- The short stock position and long futures position can be held either to the futures' settlement (expiration) date
(at which time the premium imbalance is contractually guaranteed to have disappeared)
or to an earlier date when the premium imbalance has disappeared due to market action

- In a typical sell program, the stock sales are "short" sales
The resulting proceeds are invested in fixed income instruments whose interest belongs wholly or partially to the arbitrageur,
according to a pre-arranged short interest rebate agreement with the stock lender
