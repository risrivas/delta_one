Financial Derivatives: A Quantitative Finance View

# Finance: What do we think of when we think of this word?
Money
Banks
Loans
Pensions
Mutual Funds
Hedge Funds

- Common theme: Investments
- Investing is the branch of finance with which we are most concerned


# What is investing?
The process of taking an ownershp position in an asset with the goal of receiving a positive return
by appreciation of the asset value


# Financial Products
- Some common synonyms used in finance:
Investment Assets
Investment Products
Investment Vehicles

=> financial products are assets suitable for investments

- Financial Products are a huge universe of assets, divided into 2 classes:
Cash Products = stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities
Derivatives = forwards, futures, swaps, options

# Derivatives
A derivative is an asset linked to (or "derived" from) another asset, called the underlying

- the structure and value of the derivative asset is defined by its relationship to the underlying


# Value
- consider 2 notions of financial value:
1. Price: determined on markets
2. Fair value: this corresponds to the "correct value"

- it is connected to concepts like:
time value of money
discounted cash flow analysis
arbitrage


# Arbitrage
Arbitrage is a relative valuation method, and is the ideal tool for determining the relationship
between the value of a derivative asset and the value of its underlying


# Fundamental derivative structures:
- Forwards and futures are contracts that lock in the price, 2 parties will buy and sell an asset
for at some future date; the traded asset is the underlying

- Options are similar to forwards but one party has the right not to participate at the time
the contract expires

- Swaps are linked to interest rates, allowing a floating interest rate to be switched to a fixed rate;
the underlying asset is an interest rate


# Risk
- Risk is the chance or possibility of suffering financial loss, for instance,
losing money on an investment

- One of the purpose (or even justifications) of derivatives is to serve as risk management tools
