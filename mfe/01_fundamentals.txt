Financial Derivatives: A Quantitative Finance View

# Finance: What do we think of when we think of this word?
Money
Banks
Loans
Pensions
Mutual Funds
Hedge Funds

- Common theme: Investments
- Investing is the branch of finance with which we are most concerned


# What is investing?
The process of taking an ownershp position in an asset with the goal of receiving a positive return
by appreciation of the asset value


# Financial Products
- Some common synonyms used in finance:
Investment Assets
Investment Products
Investment Vehicles

=> financial products are assets suitable for investments

- Financial Products are a huge universe of assets, divided into 2 classes:
Cash Products = stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities
Derivatives = forwards, futures, swaps, options

# Derivatives
A derivative is an asset linked to (or "derived" from) another asset, called the underlying

- the structure and value of the derivative asset is defined by its relationship to the underlying


# Value
- consider 2 notions of financial value:
1. Price: determined on markets
2. Fair value: this corresponds to the "correct value"

- it is connected to concepts like:
time value of money
discounted cash flow analysis
arbitrage


# Arbitrage
Arbitrage is a relative valuation method, and is the ideal tool for determining the relationship
between the value of a derivative asset and the value of its underlying


# Fundamental derivative structures:
- Forwards and futures are contracts that lock in the price, 2 parties will buy and sell an asset
for at some future date; the traded asset is the underlying

- Options are similar to forwards but one party has the right not to participate at the time
the contract expires

- Swaps are linked to interest rates, allowing a floating interest rate to be switched to a fixed rate;
the underlying asset is an interest rate


# Risk
- Risk is the chance or possibility of suffering financial loss, for instance,
losing money on an investment

- One of the purpose (or even justifications) of derivatives is to serve as risk management tools

# Interest Rates
#################
- interest rates are measures of the price charged in the economy to borrow money
- the charge levied to borrow money is called interest
- principal is the amount of money borrowed in a loan
- interest rate is the fraction of the principal of a loan that will be charged as interest per unit time

- thus there is a time unit implicit in an interest rate

- an annual interest rate is an interest rate for which the implicit time unit is 1 year
- quoted interest rates are usually annual interest rates

# formula:
Principal = X, annual interest rate = r

r = fraction of X charged per year
total 1 year interest = rX

total debt after 1 year = Principal + Interest
= X + rX
= X*(1+r)

# example:
P = 5000
r = 7%
Debt = 5000 * (1 + 0.07)
= 5000 * 1.07
= 5350

# Interest Rates: General Considerations
##########################################
- like any other price, interest rates are determined by market activity
- interest rates are the prices negotiated between the borrowers and lenders of money

- the market of borrowers and lenders is a diverse collection of markets which are usually viewed as divided into 2 classes:
Money Market: short term loans, primarily with loan terms up to about a year
Bond Market: debt with longer terms than a year

- interest rates are prices negotiated on these markets
- but interest rates are also heavily influenced by actions of governments and central banks


## Term structure of interest rates
- Interest rates have term structure: they are functions of the loan term (the duration of the time the loan is held)
- you will be charged a different interest rate if you borrow money for 5 years than if you borrow money for 3 months

- we use the notation r(t) to denote the interest rate for borrowing money for a loan term of t
for instance,
     r(t) = annual interest rate for a 2 year loan
let r(2) is the interest rate charged per year to borrow money for 2 years

- at times, r(t, T) notation may be used to denote the rate maturing at date T observed at time t
this implies the term to maturity is T - t


## Forces that shape interest rates
- the borrower wants to borrow money as cheaply as possible, so will take the lowest interest rate available
- the lender wants to earn the highest possible rate, but the primary cost to the lender is the risk of loss on the investment
- the universal view is that investor's require more compensation if they take on a riskier investment

- thus the basic risk-rate relationship is simple: riskier investments require a higher interest rate
- longer loan term imply higher risks

- a model that fits really well is to regard central banks as setting a base level for interest rates
- other interest rate levels are then realized as adjustments (spreads) to the central bank determined base rate, based on their risk characteristics

# Risk free interest rate
- what should be the interest rate if there is no risk?
This idea of a risk free rate is a somewhat fancy idea (there is really no such thing as a riskless investment)
but it is a core concept of derivative pricing, used universally in the subject.

- it is reasonable that such a minimal rate of return, even in the absence of risk, could exist in markets in a theoretical sense at least
- a new real-world interest rate, which is now slated to be of major market importance, may come very close to being an actual risk free interest rate:
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)
