Financial Derivatives: A Quantitative Finance View

# Finance: What do we think of when we think of this word?
Money
Banks
Loans
Pensions
Mutual Funds
Hedge Funds

- Common theme: Investments
- Investing is the branch of finance with which we are most concerned


# What is investing?
The process of taking an ownershp position in an asset with the goal of receiving a positive return
by appreciation of the asset value


# Financial Products
- Some common synonyms used in finance:
Investment Assets
Investment Products
Investment Vehicles

=> financial products are assets suitable for investments

- Financial Products are a huge universe of assets, divided into 2 classes:
Cash Products = stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities
Derivatives = forwards, futures, swaps, options

# Derivatives
A derivative is an asset linked to (or "derived" from) another asset, called the underlying

- the structure and value of the derivative asset is defined by its relationship to the underlying


# Value
- consider 2 notions of financial value:
1. Price: determined on markets
2. Fair value: this corresponds to the "correct value"

- it is connected to concepts like:
time value of money
discounted cash flow analysis
arbitrage


# Arbitrage
Arbitrage is a relative valuation method, and is the ideal tool for determining the relationship
between the value of a derivative asset and the value of its underlying


# Fundamental derivative structures:
- Forwards and futures are contracts that lock in the price, 2 parties will buy and sell an asset
for at some future date; the traded asset is the underlying

- Options are similar to forwards but one party has the right not to participate at the time
the contract expires

- Swaps are linked to interest rates, allowing a floating interest rate to be switched to a fixed rate;
the underlying asset is an interest rate


# Risk
- Risk is the chance or possibility of suffering financial loss, for instance,
losing money on an investment

- One of the purpose (or even justifications) of derivatives is to serve as risk management tools

# Interest Rates
#################
- interest rates are measures of the price charged in the economy to borrow money
- the charge levied to borrow money is called interest
- principal is the amount of money borrowed in a loan
- interest rate is the fraction of the principal of a loan that will be charged as interest per unit time

- thus there is a time unit implicit in an interest rate

- an annual interest rate is an interest rate for which the implicit time unit is 1 year
- quoted interest rates are usually annual interest rates

# formula:
Principal = X, annual interest rate = r

r = fraction of X charged per year
total 1 year interest = rX

total debt after 1 year = Principal + Interest
= X + rX
= X*(1+r)

# example:
P = 5000
r = 7%
Debt = 5000 * (1 + 0.07)
= 5000 * 1.07
= 5350

# Interest Rates: General Considerations
##########################################
- like any other price, interest rates are determined by market activity
- interest rates are the prices negotiated between the borrowers and lenders of money

- the market of borrowers and lenders is a diverse collection of markets which are usually viewed as divided into 2 classes:
Money Market: short term loans, primarily with loan terms up to about a year
Bond Market: debt with longer terms than a year

- interest rates are prices negotiated on these markets
- but interest rates are also heavily influenced by actions of governments and central banks


## Term structure of interest rates
- Interest rates have term structure: they are functions of the loan term (the duration of the time the loan is held)
- you will be charged a different interest rate if you borrow money for 5 years than if you borrow money for 3 months

- we use the notation r(t) to denote the interest rate for borrowing money for a loan term of t
for instance,
     r(t) = annual interest rate for a 2 year loan
let r(2) is the interest rate charged per year to borrow money for 2 years

- at times, r(t, T) notation may be used to denote the rate maturing at date T observed at time t
this implies the term to maturity is T - t


## Forces that shape interest rates
- the borrower wants to borrow money as cheaply as possible, so will take the lowest interest rate available
- the lender wants to earn the highest possible rate, but the primary cost to the lender is the risk of loss on the investment
- the universal view is that investor's require more compensation if they take on a riskier investment

- thus the basic risk-rate relationship is simple: riskier investments require a higher interest rate
- longer loan term imply higher risks

- a model that fits really well is to regard central banks as setting a base level for interest rates
- other interest rate levels are then realized as adjustments (spreads) to the central bank determined base rate, based on their risk characteristics

# Risk free interest rate
- what should be the interest rate if there is no risk?
This idea of a risk free rate is a somewhat fancy idea (there is really no such thing as a riskless investment)
but it is a core concept of derivative pricing, used universally in the subject.

- it is reasonable that such a minimal rate of return, even in the absence of risk, could exist in markets in a theoretical sense at least
- a new real-world interest rate, which is now slated to be of major market importance, may come very close to being an actual risk free interest rate:
the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)

# Interest Rates and Future Values
###################################
- from an investor's point of view, if we invest X at an annual interest rate r, then after 1 year,
our investment is worth = (1 + r) * X
- this formula is only correct if the interest rate is annually compounded
- for 2 years = (1 + 2*r) * X
- After 2 years, our investment grew to = (1 + 2*r)^2 * X

# Future Values
If we invest a sum of money at some fixed interest rate for some term the final value of this investment,
assuming all returns are reinvested at the same interest rate, is the future value of the initial investment.

Let r(t) be the annuallu compounded interest rate for a loan term of t years
Let P0 be the initial investment
Then the future value of P0, at time t is:
P(t) = (1 + r(t))^t * P0

The key here is rate of interest should be in t

# Example:
invest 10K at an annually compounded interest rate of 7%
what is the future value in 10 years?

P(10) = (1 + r)^10 * 10K
= 1.07 ^ 10 * 10K


##########################
# Compounding Conventions
##########################
- Periodic Compounding
Interest is said to be compounded with frequency m if interest is reinvested with the principal m times per year
Once interest is added to the principal, future interest charges are levied on the interest accrued so far as well as the initial principal

- notation:
rm(t) is still an annual interest rate, in each (m times per year) compounded period, the earned interest = rm(t)/m * X

- the value of the investment after 1 period = X * (1 + rm(t)/m)
- in the second period, earned interest = rm(t)/m * X * (1 + rm(t)/m)
= X * (1 + rm(t)/m)^2

- the future value of an investment X in t years:
P(t) = X * (1 + rm(t)/m)^mt

annual compounding => m=1
semiannual compounding => m=2
monthly compounding => m=12

- example:
Calculate the future value in 5 years of a 15K investment
semi annually rate = 6%
monthly rate = 5.5%

P(5) = 15K * (1 + 0.06/2)^2*5
= 15K * 1.03^10

P(5) = 15K * (1 + 0.055/12)^12*5

# Investment Return Measures
##############################
- Let V(t) be the value of some investment or asset at time t
- return on the investment from time t to t + T is the Gross return = V(t + T) / V(t)
- Net return = (V(t + T) - V(t)) / V(t)
- Net return = Gross return - 1

- example:
invest 18K, annual compounded rate = 8% for 1 year
what are the gross and net returns

Ans: value of investment after 1 year
= X * (1 + rt)^t
= 18K * (1 + 0.08)
= 19,440

Gross return = 19,400 / 18K = 1.08
Net return = 19,400 - 18K / 18K = 0.08

- calculate for 8% monthly compounded
m = 12

X * (1+r/m) ^ mt
= 18K * (1+0.08/12) ^ 12*1
= 19,494

Gross return = 19,494/18K = 1.083
Net return = 0.083


############################
# Interest Rate Conversions
############################
- the gross return of an investment at a periodically compounded interest rate equals the future value of an initial investment of $1
- Let P(t) = future value for investment X in t years
Gross return = P(t) / X
= ((1 + rm(t)/m)^mt * X) / X
= (1 + rm(t)/m)^mt

- Interest rates are considered equivalent if they lead to the same total return
- To calculate equivalent interest rates, we can equate gross or net returns, which is the same as equating the future value of $1
- To express rm(t) in terms of rk(t), equate:
(1 + rm(t)/m)^mt = (1 + rk(t)/k)^kt

Solving for rm(t):
rm(t) = m * (1 + rk(t)/k)^(k/m) - m

- Example:
if the annually compunded interest rate is 5% - what is the corresponding semiannually compounded interest rate?
Let r(1) = annual = 5%
r2(1) = semiannually

equating the 1 year future value of a $1 investment with 2 interest rates:
(1 + r(1)) = (1 + r2(1)/2)^2
1.05 = (1 + r2(1)/2)^2

solving for r2(1) = 0.0494 = 4.94%
