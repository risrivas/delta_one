- why invest in cryptocurrencies?
to generate profit

- how do you generate profit?
by investing in something that is undervalued

- what is the value of cryptocurrencies?
we need to look at the problems they want to solve and the value for solving these problems

----------

# Fiat (currency like USD, GBP, etc) problems that cryptocurrencies solve:
- Fiat: Governments can print as much as they want causing inflation => thus devaluing our money
- Crypto: Scarce or limited amount

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/
=> Max supply is 21M BTC and this is fixed

- Fiat: High fees involved in transferring and using (wire transfers / merchant fees)
- Crypto: Cheaper fees for transferring / paying (this is still in progress)

- Fiat: Financial institutions security beign breached, Frauds
- Crypto: Extreme security => Funds cannot be hacked

- Fiat: You have to trust someone to hold your money (i.e. Banks)
- Crypto: Immutable => don't need to trust anyone

# How cryptocurrencies work: the blockchain
############################################

## What are cryptocurrencies?
A digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency
and verify transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank
- decentralized
- trustless
- immutable
- scarce

-----------

## Hash Function
A cryptographic hash function is a hash function which takes an input (or 'message')
and returns a fixed size alphanumeric string => this string is called the 'hash value' or 'digest'

- Proprties of a good hash function:
  - efficient to compute
  - collision resistant (no 2 messages can give the same hash value)
  - hides the information of the input
  - output should look random
  - calling hash function multiple times on the same input should always return the same hash value

- Examples of hash functions:
  - Message Digest 5 (MD5) = one of the first hash functions
  - Secure Hash Algorithm (SHA):
    - SHA-1
    - SHA-224
    - SHA-256 => this is used by crypto
    - SHA-384
    - SHA-512


-----------

## Ledger
A ledger is the principal book or computer file for recording and totaling economic transactions measured
in terms of monetary unit of account by account type, with debits and credits in separate columns and
a beginning monetary balance and ending monetary balance for each account.
OR
in simpler words - its a file containing transaction(s)
=> blockchain is a chain of ledgers

# example:
suppose we have a ledger for 4 friends having their account balance
its a public ledger and anyone can read/write it

- Ledger - Day0
Moh = $100
Kam = $20
Queeny = $50
Omid = $0

- Ledger - Day1
-- transactions
Moh => Kam $20
Moh => Omid $10
Queeny => Moh $5
Kam => Queeny $10

-- balance
Moh = $75
Kam = $30
Queeny = $55
Omid = $10

- Ledger - Day2 - there is a flaw here as anyone can write to the ledge
-- so if Omid writes the ledger as
Moh => Omid $75

it means Moh has lost all his money => crypto is highly secured and it will be explained later how to fix it


-----------

## Public keys, Secret keys & digital signatures
- digital signature
a process that guarantees that the contents of a message have not been altered in transit

- public and private keys refer to the 'keys' used to encrypt/decrypt information
- public key is available to many
- private key/secret key is made available to the originator of the encrypted content

What is needed:
- a public key "Pk" and a secret key "Sk"
- a signature function:
  => SignatureFunc(Hash(info), Sk) = Signature
- a Validation function:
  => ValidationFunc(Hash(info), Signature, Pk) = True/False

- thus to fix the earlier issue
- Ledger - Day2 - there is a flaw here as anyone can write to the ledge
-- so if Omid writes the ledger as
Moh => Omid $75

this can not happen
as Moh has his secret key through which will have a unique signature

SignatureFunc(Hash(info = "Moh => Omid $75"), Moh_Sk) => Moh_Signature
so Omid will fail in validation func as he doesn't has Moh_signature to validate his transaction

- everyone in the world have their own copy of ledger as it is decentralized
- now we need to have consesus that which ledger is correct and latest copy
=> this is where blockchain comes in....


-----------

## Blockchain - part-1
A digital ledger in which transactions made in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly

- there are group of people ("miners") who will keep on creating Block Ledgers containing all the transactions
- so whenever any transaction takes place - its boradcasted and entered into Block
- once the block is completed, there is a puzzle to finish which validates all the transactions in the block before moving to another block
- if any evil transaction is done, then it will be discarded if more than 51% miners invalidate it


-----------

## Mining
- in cryptocurrency networks, mining is a validation of transactions
- for this effort, successful miners obtain new cryptocurrency as a reward
- the reward decreases transaction fees by creating a complementary incentive to contribute to the processing power of the network
- miners also get transaction fees for solving (validating) a block

- so there are group of miners who are listening to the cryptocurrency network
- suppose there is a miner who is creating his local copy of block
- once her block completes, she gets a cryptographic puzzle to solve
- puzzle can be like - hash function created of block should contain x number of 0s in it
- so the miner will keep on trying different hash functions to solve the puzzle => it takes enormous computers / resources and time to solve a puzzle
- once the puzzle is solved - miner will mark his block as public and publish it to the block chain
- now all the other miners have to solve the puzzle and publish their block to the blockchain
- final block which is published and true is the once which has more than 51% similar blocks
- longest blockchain is considered to be true and others are discarded
- so eny evil minor if he puts fake transactions - his block will not be accepted
- even if there are group of evil miners (more than 51%) - the puzzle is so difficult and resource consuming process to solve
that it will cost more to solve the puzzle by 51% miners rather than the money it can make from evil transactions

- on average it takes 10 mins to solve the puzzle by a miner
- reward of solving a block is 12.5 bitcoin
- normally miners work in groups and pool their computer resources to solve the puzzle
- the reward of bitcoins will decrease every 4 years => by 2044 no bitcoins will be rewarded and miners will make money only by transaction fees
- mining is a very hard business and their are small companies with group of miners working together to solve the blocks and earn

- mining work is also called as Proof of Work (POW)


-----------

## Blockchain - part-2

Bitcoin blockchain:
- public & permission-less
- cryptographic hash function
- digital signatures, public and private keys
- P2P (point to point) network
- Proof of work (POW) consensus algorithm

What users get:
- do transactions without needing to trust anyone
- decentralized: everyone has all the information at any time
- cryptographic puzzles, coupled with game theory gives no incentive for someone to be a bad actor

- all the blocks are connected - so block 2 will have hash of block 1
- if anyone tries to change any block in blockchain, it will create a new hash which will break the chain
- thus blockchain is immutable

- blockchain technology can be used in many other applications (like govt elections, files validations, etc)

## Quiz 1
- What is a Blockchain?
A digital ledger where transactions are recorded chronologically and publicly

- What do you need to spend (or transfer) your cryptocurrency?
Your secret key => You can digitally sign a transaction (spend a crypto) by using your Secret Key

- What is the current Hash Function used by the Bitcoin Protocol?
SHA-256
