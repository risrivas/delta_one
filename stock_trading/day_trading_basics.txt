- profits in trading do not come from reading a book or two, articles, online courses or youtube
- profits can come only with practice (your own money involved), the right tools and software and proper ongoing education
- need not to master any complex strategies
- only master the well-known strategies that has worked for decades and just adjust / tweak it with the current market condition
- as per the brokers records, only 16% traders make money


# Rule 1: Day trading is not a strategy to get rich quickly


- if day trading was simple, then everyone would have been a successful trader
- it has a brutal learning curve - normally 15-year experienced trader read around 100-400 books or articles to add to their knowledge
- trading in a simulator account with fake money can expedite the learning curve
- on an average, a trader starts making money from around 6-months to 1-year if she is around experienced traders community
- its a zero sum game - traders make profit when other traders lose => there is no money generation in stock market
- impulsive, gambling-prone, emotional and greedy traders always lose money


# Rule 2: Day trading is not easy; it's a serious business


- pros:
- an average successful trader makes around $500-1K everyday - i.e. around $10K-$20K per month (20 days in a month)
- lifestyle is good - as its all own money and trading from home
- only work for 4-5 hours per day or less once the daily target is achieved
- per day profit can go upto $2K everyday if anyone has mastered the day trading profession
