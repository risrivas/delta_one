## What is Hedge ?
Hedge is an investment to reduce the risk of adverse price movement in an asset.
Normally, a hedge consists of taking an offsetting position in a related security, such as a futures contract.

- example
CSI500 index price = 16K
CSI500 ETF price = 16K
CSI500 index future price = 16K

Buy: ETF, Sell: Futures as hedge

Case 1: CSI500 index price goes up by 1% (16160)
- earn 160 points from ETF => 16160 - 16000
- lose 160 points from futures
- Net earnings = 0

Case 2: CSI500 index price goes down by 1% (15840)
- lose 160 points from ETF => 15840 - 16000
- earn 160 points from futures
- Net earnings = 0

## What is Arbitrage ? (Special case of hedge)
Arbitrage is simultaneously buy and sell of an asset to profit from difference in the price.
It is a trade that profits by exploiting the price differences of related instruments on different markets or in different forms.

- example
CSI500 index price = 16K
CSI500 ETF price = 16K
CSI500 index future price = 16200 --

Buy: ETF, Sell: Futures as hedge

Case 1: CSI500 index price goes up by 1% (16160)
- earn 160 points from ETF => 16160 - 16000
- earn 40 points from futures => 16200 - 16160
- Net earnings = 200

Case 2: CSI500 index price goes down by 1% (15840)
- lose 160 points from ETF => 15840 - 16000
- earn 360 points from futures => 16200 - 15840
- Net earnings = 200
