## What is Hedge ?
Hedge is an investment to reduce the risk of adverse price movement in an asset.
Normally, a hedge consists of taking an offsetting position in a related security, such as a futures contract.

- example
CSI500 index price = 16K
CSI500 ETF price = 16K
CSI500 index future price = 16K

Buy: ETF, Sell: Futures as hedge

Case 1: CSI500 index price goes up by 1% (16160)
- earn 160 points from ETF => 16160 - 16000
- lose 160 points from futures
- Net earnings = 0

Case 2: CSI500 index price goes down by 1% (15840)
- lose 160 points from ETF => 15840 - 16000
- earn 160 points from futures
- Net earnings = 0


--------------

## What is Arbitrage ? (Special case of hedge)
Arbitrage is simultaneously buy and sell of an asset to profit from difference in the price.
It is a trade that profits by exploiting the price differences of related instruments on different markets or in different forms.

- example
CSI500 index price = 16K
CSI500 ETF price = 16K
CSI500 index future price = 16200

Buy: ETF, Sell: Futures as hedge

Case 1: CSI500 index price goes up by 1% (16160)
- earn 160 points from ETF => 16160 - 16000
- earn 40 points from futures => 16200 - 16160
- Net earnings = 200

Case 2: CSI500 index price goes down by 1% (15840)
- lose 160 points from ETF => 15840 - 16000
- earn 360 points from futures => 16200 - 15840
- Net earnings = 200


--------------

## What is IndexArb ?

- IndexArb automates Futures Index Arbitrage and ETF market making
- Actively quote Futures / ETF and arbitrage the spread opportunites

- Quote component
Place simultaneous passive buy/sell limit orders for ETF/Futures and maintain the bid/ask size

- Hedge component
When the Quote order execution amount exceeds a delta trigger range, a hedge order (either a cash basket or Futures) is fired

- Supported Quote/Hedge Pairs
ETF vs Futures
Futures vs Cash Basket
ETF vs Cash Basket
Futures vs Futures

# Quote Component example

CSI500 ETF as quote
CSI500 index future as hedge


Steps to quote:
===================

1. Calculate theoretical price of quote and hedge symbols, from base symbol which is CSI500 index
TheoPrice_ETF = NetAssetValue * ( 1 + (CashRatio * LeverageRatio) * (Index_Last / Index_PrevClose - 1) )
TheoPrice_Future = (Index_Last + HedgeCarryCost) * ETF_Multiplier

2. Calculate theoretical spread
Theo_Spread = TheoPrice_ETF - TheoPrice_Future

3. Calculate ETF theoretical market price (bid/ask) of quote symbol which is CSI500 ETF
TheoMarketPrice_ETF_Ask = Theo_Spread + (Futures_Ask * ETF_Multiplier)
TheoMarketPrice_ETF_Bid = Theo_Spread + (Futures_Bid * ETF_Multiplier)

4. Trader inputs ETF Bid or Ask Spread => BidSpreadIndexPoints or AskSpreadIndexPoints

5. Calculate final ETF quote price (bid/ask)
QuotePrice_ETF_Ask = TheoMarketPrice_ETF_Ask + AskSpreadIndexPoints
QuotePrice_ETF_Bid = TheoMarketPrice_ETF_Bid - BidSpreadIndexPoints

- basic idea is to calculate final ETF quote price (step 5) and compare with actual ETF market "best" bid / ask price

- Join "ETF Best Ask" if QuotePrice_ETF_Ask (step 5) <= "ETF Best Ask"
because we assume that ETF is over-priced in market (short)

- Join "ETF Best Bid" if QuotePrice_ETF_Bid (step 5) >= "ETF Best Ask"
because we assume that ETF is under-priced in market (long)

# Terms used above

## Net Asset Value of ETF
The NAV is determined by adding up the value of all assets in the fund, including assets and cash, subtracting any liabilities,
and then dividing that value by the number of outstanding shares in the ETF.

- The ETF market price is the price at which shares in the ETF can be bought or sold on the exchanges "during trading hours".
- The net asset value (NAV) of an ETF represents the value of each share’s portion of the fund’s underlying assets and cash at the "end of the trading day".

## Cash Ratio
Cash Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
The cash ratio is a measurement of a company's liquidity, specifically the ratio of a company's total cash and cash equivalents to its current liabilities.

## LeverageRatio
Leverage Ratio = Total Debt / Total Equity
- A leveraged exchange-traded fund (ETF) uses financial derivatives and debt to amplify the returns of an underlying index.
- While a traditional ETF typically tracks the securities in its underlying index on a one-to-one basis, a leveraged ETF may aim for a 2:1 or 3:1 ratio.
- Leverage is a double-edged sword meaning it can lead to significant gains, but can also lead to significant losses.
example:
ETFs that track the S&P 500 Index will contain the 500 stocks in the S&P. Typically, if the S&P moves 1%, the ETF will also move by 1%.
A leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P might use financial products and debt that magnify each 1% gain in the S&P to a 2% or 3% gain.

## ETF Multiplier
- Same as Leverage Ratio
- For example - if ETF multipler is 3, it means:
Leveraged 3X ETFs are funds that track a wide variety of asset classes, such as stocks, bonds and commodity futures,
 and apply leverage in order to gain three times the daily or monthly return of the respective underlying index.

## Futures contract multiplier
The contract multiplier determines the dollar value of each point of price movement.
The E-mini Dow multiplier is 5, meaning each Dow point is worth $5 per contract.
The E-mini Nasdaq multiplier is 20, worth $20 per point, while the E-mini SP-500 carries a 50 multiplier that's worth $50 per point.
So, to summarize, if index is at say 1500 points and futures contract multiplier is 200, then price of futures contract is 1500 * 200 = 30_00_00

## Carry Cost
Expenses for futures contract to hold or carry it - like storage cost (for commodities) .

F = Se ^ ((r + s - c) x t)
Where:

F = the future price of the commodity
S = the spot price of the commodity
e = the base of natural logs, approximated as 2.718
r = the risk-free interest rate
s = the storage cost, expressed as a percentage of the spot price
c = the convenience yield
t = time to delivery of the contract, expressed as a fraction of one year

===================

## example - so should understand theoretical price vs actual market price

using ETF "Ask"

Assume
# Theoretical spread calculation:
- Step 3: ETF theoretical market price ask, TheoMarketPrice_ETF_Ask = 120
- Futures theoretical market price ask, Futures_Ask = 100
- Theoretical market price spread = TheoMarketPrice_ETF_Ask - Futures_Ask => 20

- Step 4: ETF Ask spread input by trader = AskSpreadIndexPoints => 10
this is market making spread which trader has been doing

- Step 5: QuotePrice_ETF_Ask = TheoMarketPrice_ETF_Ask + AskSpreadIndexPoints => 120 + 10 => 130

# Market price available:
However, ETF actual market Price ask = 135
This is arbitrage opportunity => Join "ETF Best Ask" to short
because we think ETF is overpriced = 135 - 120 => 15 arbitrage profit

======================

## How to Join?

# Leap-Frog Pegging
- The quote component continually adjusts buy/sell orders on the exchange
It means that whenever a fill happens, need to send additional orders to "adjust" the Bid/Ask Size
- This adjustment is done by a method Leap-Frog Pegging:
orders on the front level are moved to the back level, and vice versa
advantage is the middle levels are not touched, preserving the exchange queue position

- example:
Order Book

Price|Qty
104.0
103.0|10, 45
101.0|90
100.0|20, 60, 200
97.0|30, 70
96.0|80, 200, 100

Suppose if Quote Price change from 96.0 to 97.0 => we need to adjust the display size
Cancel all the 3 orders at 96.0 and send those orders with same qty at best bid price - 104.0 price (103.0 + (97.0-96.0))

Suppose if Quote Price change from 97.0 to 96.0 => we need to adjust the display size
Cancel all the orders at best bid price (104.0) and send those orders with same qty at 96.0 price (97.0 - (97.0-96.0))


##################
# Hedge Component
##################
- if executed position of Quote is >= MaxDelta (pre-configured to a value) => Hedge orders are triggered to fire
- quote is prevented from reloading until Hedge is sufficiently filled

# Strategies:
- market making mode
Net the delta of the quote asset => meaning that buying and selling qty offset each other
- arbitrage mode
do not Net the delta => meaning both buy and sell fill qty will sum up

# Steps to Hedge (arbitrage mode only):
1. Calculate Exec Delta (Quote/Hedge orders that has been filled on the exchange)
sum(quote fills + hedge fills)

QuoteFills = (QuoteBuyExecQty - QuoteSellExecQty) * TheoPrice * LeverageRatio * FuturesContractMultiplier
HedgeFills = sum( (HedgeBuyExecQty - HedgeSellExecQty) * TheoPrice ) * FuturesContractMultiplier
ExecDelta = QuoteFills + HedgeFills

2. Calculate Order Delta (ExecDelta + unexecuted hedge orders)

QuoteSellExecDelta = -QuoteSellExecQty * TheoPrice * LeverageRatio * FuturesContractMultiplier
HedgeBuyOrders = HedgeBuyTotalQty * TheoPrice * FuturesContractMultiplier
=> OrderDeltaSB = QuoteSellExecDelta + HedgeBuyOrders

QuoteBuyExecDelta = QuoteBuyExecQty * TheoPrice * LeverageRatio * FuturesContractMultiplier
HedgeSellOrders = HedgeSellTotalQty * TheoPrice * FuturesContractMultiplier
=> OrderDeltaBS = QuoteBuyExecDelta + HedgeSellOrders

3. When to Hedge?
- if OrderDeltaBS > MaxDelta,  send sell Hedge orders until OrderDeltaBS <= MaxDelta
- if OrderDeltaSB < -MaxDelta, send buy Hedge orders until OrderDeltaSB >= -MaxDelta

- Quote cannot reload on the bid side if ExecDelta > MaxDelta
- Quote cannot reload on the offer side if ExecDelta < -MaxDelta

4. How to Hedge?
- Fire and Forget
When an order is placed by Hedge Component, it trades independently of other logic

- Full order qty
Hedge Component posts full order quantity in one tranche at the calculated price level

- Order Book Ratio
If ratio of level 1 quote (bid/ask for buys and ask/bid for sells) exceeds the user specified value,
the strategy will cross the spread with all qty

- Timer
If bid-ask spread is greater than 1 tick, every X seconds,
the child order price should be amended to be 1 tick more aggressive in price (but never cross the spread)

- Bid chasing
Hedge component always chases the best bid/offer

====================

## Hedge Component - example

- Stock X has
best offer = 302
best bid = 300
tick size = 1

- Strategy
Timer = 30 seconds
OrderBookRatio = 2

- Place a buy hedge order for 1000 shares
- Hedge component first places the entire qty at best bid, 300
- After 30 seconds, check bid-ask spread = 2 which is greater than tick size of 1
=> the hedge component amends it's child order to 301
- if there are more than twice as many shares on the best bid as on the best offer,
then amend the order limit price to 302 hitting all the shares on the offer and becoming the new best bid

-------

# Algo

Start -> Post at Best Bid
         -> Post at Best Bid + 1 ticks after 30 seconds (amend price only)
            -> Post at Best Bid + 2 ticks after 30 seconds (amend price only)
...
...
                -> Post at Best Ask - 1 ticks after 30 seconds (amend price only)
                     -> Check OrderBookRatio - if there are more than OrderBookRatio (say, twice) as many shares on the best bid as on the best ask
                         -> Amend Price to Best Ask and hit all the orders at Best Ask => expected to get all the hedge buy orders filled immediately
                         -> New Best Bid is Best Ask on which orders are hit

Whenever the best bid changes, amend the price to Best Bid and start the timer again
