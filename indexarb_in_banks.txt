- IndexArb strategy automates:
ETF/Futures Market making
Futures Index arbitrage

- Strategy is designed to trade pair of assets:
ETF vs Futures
Futures vs Cash Basket
ETF vs Cash Basket
Futures vs Futures

- 3 types of sub-strategies are supported:
1) ETF/Futures Market making
- Quoting => Send buy and sell orders for ETF / Futures on multiple levels based on the theoretical price of the product
- Reload => Maintain display size by sending additional orders as earlier orders are executed
- Hedging => Send Futures / Cash Basket / ETF as a hedge once a certain execution threshold is reached (MaxDelta)

2) Opening Auction Arbitrage
- Send buy and sell asset pair (Cash Basket and Futures OR ETF and Futures) on opening auction if there is profit opportunity
according to the estimated opening spread between theoretical price and market price of the Futures
- note that this strategy can be used in regular trading hours and not just auction periods


3) Cash Basket Market making (Cash First)
- Quoting => Send cash basket orders based on the spread between theoretical price and market price of the Futures
- Reload => Maintain display size by sending additional orders as earlier orders are executed
- Hedging => Send Futures as a hedge once a certain execution threshold is reached (MaxDelta)

# Workflow/System Overview
###########################
- System Diagram should be like this:

1) UI - where user can control Parent order and strategy
Incoming:
- Static data
- Index Data from Index Pricer
- Realtime Market Data
- Cash Basket from BCS

Outgoing: Parent Order

2) Algo Engine - where UI will publish the parent order to
Gets Index calculations - Executes the strategy
Send Child Orders to Exchange connectivity layer or broker which will send to market / exchange
Executions received should be sent to booking systems in realtime

3) Exchange connectivity layer or broker
Receives child orders from Algo Engine
massages it according to broker or exchange FIX/native protocol\
sends to market

4) Booking system
receives real-time executions from algo engine
sends to risk system

5) Risk system for risk management

-------------

## Parent Orders
- Trading is initiated by sending a 'Parent Order' from UI to Algo Engine
- Strategy only trade up to the quantity limit of ETF/Futures/Cash Basket from UI
- Strategy checks the balance of quote and hedge product value and does not accept if the total value of the hedge
product is larger than the equivalent value of quantity limit
- Strategy will stop once it consumes all slices of the basket


## Parent Order Control
- User can set-up configuration for 'Parent Order' (Template) via the UI
- Template consists of a Quote (ETF/Future) and a Hedge (Future or Cash Basket)
- Parent Orders can be controlled using a series of commands from the UI (as listed below)

# Command (UI -> Algo Engine)
1. Start
- Send message to start trading
- Strategy references previous executions (if any) to track trading delta and remaining inventory

2. Kill
- Send message to stop trading
- All child orders are cancelled and no further orders are sent
- Parent order state and parameters (except trading delta and remaining inventory) are reset

3. Pause
- Send message to suspend trading
- This cancels and stops sending quote orders but hedge activities continue
- Opening Auction strategy does not support Pause

4. Resume
- Sends message to restart quote activity from suspended state

5. Update Parameter
- The strategy adjusts the number, size and price of child orders according to the updated parameters
- Strategy will ack the request without waiting for the result of the action of child orders
- Strategy supports the following parameters updates
  - Pricing parameters: CarryCost, HedgeCarryCost, Ask/Bid Spread, Ask/Bid OutSpread, NAV, CashRatio, ETFMultiplier
  - ETF/Futures Market Making parameters: Ask/Bid DisplayLevel, Ask/Bid DisplaySize, Max Long/Short OrderQuantity, Inventory, ReloadPercent
  - Opening Auction Parameters: Ask/Bid DisplaySize, Max Long/Short OrderQuantity
  - Cash First parameters: ReloadPercent, Max Long/Short OrderQuantity
  - Delta parameters: MaxDelta, StopReloadDelta
  - Hedge parameters: HedgeDisplaySize
  - Timing parameters: StartTime, EndTime, QuoteEndTime
- Stale parameter check to ensure strategy cannot start if product parameters have not been updated that day

6. Cancel Stock
- Send message to cancel single stock orders in basket
- The strategy will cancel all the child orders of the symbol for the parent order
- This command is supported by ETF/Futures Market Making with cash hedge or cash first strategies only

7. Force Reload
- Sends a message to reset the delta information and enable the quote orders to reload again
- Only supported by the ETF/Futures market-making strategy with hedge disabled

8. Enable/Commit Manual Hedge Input
- To send/update the information of the manual traded position
- During the manual hedge input, the strategy cancels the hedge orders and does not send new ones
