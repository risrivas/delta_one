# Investing vs Trading vs Gambling
- Investing
Long-Term Play
For specific goals
Have a plan - stick to it
Rebalance as needed
Can succeed with basic principles over time

- Trading
Fun
Takes a lot of work
More money - diversified (20-30 stocks) + more transaction fees
Behavioral issues - willing to sell losers, winners
Succeed by personal skill

- Gambling
Fun
Expect to lose (casino particularly)
Limit loss (only money in pocket)
Is Day Trading gambling?
