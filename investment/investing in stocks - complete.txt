# Two ways investors make money
- Growth - Capital Appreciation
Buy Low & Sell High
Trade (I buy you sell)
Beware - stocks can go down and never recover

- Dividends
Regular passive income
Quarterly payout
Thank you for holding stock/owner
Beware - dividend cut or elimination

- Combination
Growth Stock
Dividend Payer


# Investing vs Trading vs Gambling
- Investing
Long-Term Play
For specific goals
Have a plan - stick to it
Rebalance as needed
Can succeed with basic principles over time

- Trading
Fun
Takes a lot of work
More money - diversified (20-30 stocks) + more transaction fees
Behavioral issues - willing to sell losers, winners
Succeed by personal skill

- Gambling
Fun
Expect to lose (casino particularly)
Limit loss (only money in pocket)
Is Day Trading gambling?


# What is a Stock?
- Common Stock (Public company)
Owner
Claim on company assets and earnings
Publically sold on a market
 NYSE, Nasdaq
 DJIA (30 USA), Nikkei (225 Japan)
Voting rights
Not involved with day to day operations
Better performance vs other investments in the long-run


# Where do stocks fit in a diversified portfolio?
Consider:
- how far away is the goal
- your risk tolerance
- need (income/growth/combo)


# Sample Portfolio Allocation

# Understanding Risk
#####################
- The chance that you buy a stock and the price goes down => reducing your profit
- Risk = Reward
- Increase Risk = Increased Reward
- Decrease Risk = Decreased Reward

- Big questions:
Can we measure risk?
Are there ways to measure if one stock is "riskier" than another?
Is it worth it to take on more risk to get that reward (investing profits)?

- Compare and evaluate different stocks
- More than a "gut feel" or rule of thumb:
e.g. Technology stocks are riskier than Utilities? - need to check if statistically true
- Give us a feel for volatility

# Volatility
- the degree to which a stock's price moves
- a stock with a price that fluctuates wildly - wide range of highs and lows or
moves erratically - is considerd highly volatile
- a stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility
