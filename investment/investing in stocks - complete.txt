# Two ways investors make money
- Growth - Capital Appreciation
Buy Low & Sell High
Trade (I buy you sell)
Beware - stocks can go down and never recover

- Dividends
Regular passive income
Quarterly payout
Thank you for holding stock/owner
Beware - dividend cut or elimination

- Combination
Growth Stock
Dividend Payer


# Investing vs Trading vs Gambling
- Investing
Long-Term Play
For specific goals
Have a plan - stick to it
Rebalance as needed
Can succeed with basic principles over time

- Trading
Fun
Takes a lot of work
More money - diversified (20-30 stocks) + more transaction fees
Behavioral issues - willing to sell losers, winners
Succeed by personal skill

- Gambling
Fun
Expect to lose (casino particularly)
Limit loss (only money in pocket)
Is Day Trading gambling?


# What is a Stock?
- Common Stock (Public company)
Owner
Claim on company assets and earnings
Publically sold on a market
 NYSE, Nasdaq
 DJIA (30 USA), Nikkei (225 Japan)
Voting rights
Not involved with day to day operations
Better performance vs other investments in the long-run


# Where do stocks fit in a diversified portfolio?
Consider:
- how far away is the goal
- your risk tolerance
- need (income/growth/combo)


# Sample Portfolio Allocation
Vanguard Sample Allocation
- Average annual return
- Best year
- Worst year
- # Years with a loss
- Large cap stocks / bonds / treasury's

https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/education/model-portfolio-allocation

- many people prefer 70-80% stocks and 20-30% bonds or fixed income
- if 100% stocks - then should have 20-30 stocks in portfolio

# Stocks categorization
########################

# Stock diversification options
- Size categories: small cap / mid cap / large cap
- Style: Growth / Income (Value)
- International
- Sectors


# Size categories: small cap / mid cap / large cap
- cap = stock price * number of shares (float)
- general cap ranges:
large cap = $10B+
mid cap = $2-10B
small cap = < $2B

- why care?
Portfolio composition
Diversity inside the asset class
Reduce risk
Narrow research


# How are stocks organized?
- Size
- Style
- Sector

# Style: Growth Stocks
- High-fliers that keep climbing
- Earnings grow faster than industry and market
  Revenue and/or cash flow
  Higher Price to Earnings (P/E)
  Higher Price to Sales
- Typically no dividend and focus on re-invest cash in growing company
- Example: Google
- most technology stocks are growth stocks

# Style: Income Stocks
- Pay a dividend (income)
- Still want growth
  price increase
  dividend increase
- example: Coca-Cola
- Sometimes labeled Value stocks
  Mutual fund style box to differentiate from Growth
  Value more an investment strategy
  Find undervalued stocks with a lower price relative to a companies true value

# Style: Value Stocks
- Many times associated with Income
- Lower price relative to fundamentals
- "Bargain Hunting"
- Great companies at discounted rates
- Higher long-term gain
- Greater risk
- May just be a dog and never recover


# Sectors
- What part of the economy
- What is ther primary business
- Important for comparison to competitors (Ratios)
- Example: Health Care
  Pharmaceutical (Merck)
  Medical Devices (Medtronic)
  Amgen (Bio Technology)

- Companies tend to move in concert with their sector
- Compare
Vanguard Energy Index (VENAX)
S&P 500
Exxon (XOM)

- The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) defines these 11 sectors:
  - Energy
  - Materials
  - Industrials
  - Consumer Discretionary
  - Consumer Staples
  - Health Care
  - Financials
  - Information Technology
  - Communication Services
  - Utilities
  - Real Estate

# Understanding Risk
#####################
- The chance that you buy a stock and the price goes down => reducing your profit
- Risk = Reward
- Increase Risk = Increased Reward
- Decrease Risk = Decreased Reward

- Big questions:
Can we measure risk?
Are there ways to measure if one stock is "riskier" than another?
Is it worth it to take on more risk to get that reward (investing profits)?

- Compare and evaluate different stocks
- More than a "gut feel" or rule of thumb:
e.g. Technology stocks are riskier than Utilities? - need to check if statistically true
- Give us a feel for volatility

# Volatility
- the degree to which a stock's price moves
- a stock with a price that fluctuates wildly - wide range of highs and lows or
moves erratically - is considerd highly volatile
- a stock that maintains a relatively stable price has low volatility

# Standard Deviation
- Statistically, SD measures the dispersion of data from its expected value
- For stocks, mutual funds and ETFs, it indicates how much the current return is deviating from its expected historical normal returns
- a stock that has high SD experiences higher volatility and thus, a higher level of risk is associated with the stock
- Key takeaway:
higher the SD, the greater the possible outcomes, high and low, thus more volatility

- example:
Vanguard S&P 500 Index ETF (VOO) => SD = 5.31
Vanguard Wellesley Fund (VWINX) Balanced Fund 40% stocks, 60% Bonds => SD = 2.22
Fidelity IT Services Fund (FBSOX) concentrated tech  => SD = 6.46

- Formula for SD
sq root of ( sum(xi - X)**2 / (n-1) )

xi = ith point in the data set
X = mean or average
n = number of points in the data set

1. calculate mean = add all data points and divide by n
2. calculate variance = subtract mean from the value of the data point then square it and take the whole summation => then divide by n-1
3. SD is sq root of variance


# Sharpe Ratio
- SR adjusts a portfolio's past performance - or expected future performance - for the "excess risk" that was taken by the investor
- US treasury bond or T-Bill can never default
- thus, removing the rate of return on "risk-free" investment (like T-Bill) from the experienced rate of return
- Think, I can make X with a risk-free investment, am I getting the extra return by taking on more risk and by how much

- Key Takeaway
SR above 1.0 is good because you are getting excess returns relative to its volatility

- Formula for SR
(Rp - Rf) / SD

Rp = return of portfolio
Rf = risk-free rate
SD = standard deviation of the portfolio's excess return

1. Subtract the risk-free rate from the return of the portfolio
risk-free rate could be a US Treasury rate or yield, such as the one-year or two-year Treasury yield

2. Divide the result by the SD of the portfolio's excess return.
SD helps to show how much the portfolio's return deviates from the expected return
SD also sheds light on the portfolio's volatility

- example:
Mutual Fund returned 15% over the last year
Current risk-free rate (T-Bill) is 3.5%
SD = 12%
SR calculation = (15 - 3.5) / 12 = 95.8% or 0.958
Since less than 1.0 => not a great SR
Conclusion is you are taking on more risk relative to returns

# Sortino Ratio
differs from the Sharpe Ratio in that it only considers the SD of the downside risk, rather than that of the entire (upside + downside) risk

- Formula for Sortino Ratio
(Rp - Rf) / SD

Rp = return of portfolio
Rf = risk-free rate
SD = standard deviation of the portfolio's downside


# Treynor Ratio
- measures how successful an investment is in providing compensation to investors for taking on investment risk
- TR is reliant upon a portfolio's beta - ie, the sensitivity of the portfolio's returns to movements in the market - to judge risk

- Formula for TR
(Rp - Rf) / B

Rp = return of portfolio
Rf = risk-free rate
B = Beta of the portfolio


==> big idea:
how much excess return am I getting on a portfolio or basket of holdings for the amount of risk I am taking on?
basically, how much above a "risk-free" rate can I get?


## Beta (excess volatility)
- measures the amount of risk (Volatility) a stock, mutual fund or ETF has relative to a broader index
- broader index like S&P 500 or Nifty 50 is assigned a beta of 1.0
- evaluate based on relation to that 1.0 market rate

# How to evaluate Beta?
- Between 0 and 1.0: less volatile than the market - cash has Beta of 0
- Equals 1.0: if a stock has beta of 1.0, it will move in the same direction as the index by the same amount
- Greater than 1.0: volatility is greater than broader index
- Negative: moves opposite direction of the index (example Gold ETF)


## Alpha (excess returns)
- goes hand in hand with Beta
- refers to excess returns earned on an investment above the benchmark or index return
- represent the value that a portfolio manager adds to or subtracts from a fund's return,
beyond what you could get with a passive index fund

- positive number means outperformed the broader index
- negative number means underperformed the broader index
- actual number is the percentage of over or under performance

# Calculate Alpha
- calculate the return of a stock or ETF and subtract the return of the associated index
- make sure using same time periods
- example:
Stock A return is 4% and Index return was 10% => Alpha = -6% (-0.06)
Stock B return is 15% and Index return was 10% => Alpha = 5% (0.05)


## R-Squared
- statistical measure that represents the %age of a portfolio or stock's movements that
can be explained by or attributed to movements in a benchmark index
- range from 0 to 100
- value between 85-100 has a performance record that is closely correlated to the index
- value less than 70 means does not perform like the index

- Formula
R-Squared = 1 - (Unexplained Variation / Total Variation)


## Risk Categories
# Systematic Risk
- associated with the broader market
- something that is impacting many, including stocks you own
- example: war, Covid

# Un-systematic Risk
- associated with a particular company, industry or sector
- example:
Saudi Arabia cuts oil production. That would impact the oil industry and oil stocks like
Exxon-Mobil (XOM) more than the broader market


## Looking up risk
- mainly look Beta
- can be got for free or may be difficult to get if paid sites

- example:
Xcel Energy (XEL): Utility
Kraft Heinz (KHC): Food Manufacturer
Amazon (AMZN): eCommerce / Web Services
Tesla (TSLA): Electric Vehicles
