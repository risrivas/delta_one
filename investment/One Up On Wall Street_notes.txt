- easiest way for a layman who doesn't have knowledge or time about stock market => should invest every month 15% of salary in index funds
- fundamental: a successful company goes public -> earnings rise -> share price follows along => best for long term investment (3 years to 15 years)
- exit (sell) the stock with atleast 10% profit OR if its very likely the price will go down - especially on quarterly reports

- example - during dot com bubble in 1999-2000, many startup dot com companies had huge stock rise quickly
- P/E ratio - there is no earnings here - only the stock price
- if 1 company stock sells at $30, and other company at $10 => it does NOT mean that first company is better
- only thing to follow is Earnings, not the current stock price

- although there is no earnings for dot com, lets calculate its Market Cap, say its $10 billion (100 million float and $100 price)
- to become a 10 bagger for dot com - its market cap should become $100 billion from $10 billion
- this is only possible if price rises from $100 to $1000
OR earnings increase by 40 times
OR dot com should earn $2.5B a year

- never invest in any company without doing study on
company's earnings
financial condition
competitive position
plans for expansion

- in general, 6 out of 10 stocks investment should give positive returns

- as stock price rises, the dividend yield naturally falls
ex: $50 stock pays $5 dividend = dividend yield 10%
if price moves up to $100 = dividend yield 5%

- companies are not giving dividends as much like before and use the profit for new venture or buy back own shares
- reducing the supply of shares increases earnings per share
