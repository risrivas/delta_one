# Investment Approach
######################
- Passive (very diversified products / vehicles with little amount invested per month)
- Active (lot of rebalancing and selective products, heavy and frequent investments)


------------------------------------

### Why Invest ?

# Grow wealth

# Retire
- Retire early (replace salary with profits)
- Retire with more money

example:
- If invest 15% of income every year on an index fund (say S&P 500 index),
the profits are much more than 40 years of work and salary saved!

# To make a big purchase
- Buy house, car, travel the world, etc


------------------------------------

### Fundamentals of investing

############
# Inflation
############
- general rise in price level relative to available goods
example:
a pizza which was 5 dollars 6 years back wll cost 10 dollars today

- each country has yearly some %age of inflation rate
example:
USA and Canada has around 2% of inflation rate per year

- Inflation is measured using the CPI (Consumer Price Index) which tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services each year

# Effects of Inflation
- if cash is saved in "tijori" for a long perod of time - it will lose it value as per the inflation rate per year
- now everyone gets salary in bank accounts - ensure that the interest rate provided by bank per year is greater than inflation rate
- same goes with salary, rents, etc - if dont get salary hike atleast equal to inflation rate or any bonus - find another job :)


##############
# Compounding
##############
- reinvest the interest to the principal in the next period

- example:
Principal = 10K
Rate = 10% p.a.
Period = 10 years

- Simple interest
every year get 1K interest and enjoy with it (not reinvest to Principal)
Simple interest profit after 10 years = P * R * T
= 10K * 0.1 * 10
= 10K

- Compound interest
every year get 1K interest and reinvest to Principal
Compound interest profit after 10 years = P * (1 + R) ^ T
= 10K (1 + 0.1) ^ 10
= 25,937.424601

# Stocks
##########

# Private Corporations
- company whose shares are not traded publicly
- owned by a small group of people - owners, employees, friends, family and qualified investors

# Stock or Shares
- investment that represents part ownership in a corporation
- when we buy shares in a company, we own proportionally part of that company


# example of starting a private corporation
- Suppose a young computer student geek named Rob has learnt how to make drones.
- He makes some drones in his home / garage and sells it to few friends.
- He makes more and more drones and sells to more people.
- Doing so for a year, he made 100K dollars in a year and has become popular.
- Now he can start his own company with 100% ownserhip - Super Drones.
- Benefits: will save tax, anyone wants to sue for bad drone - can only sue the company (not Rob individually) which will lead to some fines etc.
- Many more people want to buy drones from Super Drones and now it becomes unmanageable for Rob to handle it alone.
- He decides to open a big store with few employees like salesman, security, accountants etc.
- He needs 2M dollars to open such a big store.
- He hires a professional (accountant or lawyer) to evaluate number of shares to issue and price for each share
- Suppose the total number of shares comes out to be 100K and the price of each share is 2M/50K = 40 dollars
- Then he can sell 50% ownership (50K shares) of Super Drones to = family, friends, qualified investors.
- Other 50K shares are held by Rob.
- He gets 2M dollars and opens the store and gets employees as planned.
- The company makes profit of 1M dollars in 1 year.
- Rob gets 500K dollars of the profit.

=> going public

- Rob and his private investors (family, friends, qualified investors) now want to spread the business to other cities across the nation.
- Total budget to open stores and hire employees is 200M
- Rob needs to do IPO (initial public offering) and go public
- A public company needs to get audited every 3 months - to ensure that whatever financials / incomes they are reporting is correct
and their share prices truly reflect their incomes
- He needs to contact an underwriting firm (usually an investment bank)
- Underwriting firm will evaluate the financial statements and everything else (analysis) and come up with % breakdown of shares
- They suggest few things after all the analysis:
  - 70% of the shares to public, 15% to Rob and remaining 15% to other private investors (initial shareholders when company was private)
  - To raise 200M, they also mention stock splits and raise from 100K to 10M shares, 7M to public, remaining 1.5M each to Rob and private shareholders
  - Cost of each share = 200M/7M = 28.57 dollars
  - Float (shares available to trade for public) = 7M

this is "primary" market =>
- Underwriting firms have good contacts with big firms, institutional investors and they convince them to buy 7M shares

this is "secondary" market =>
- After a specific date, they will sell the shares in the secondary market where all public can trade
- Underwriting firm will find the exchange where company will be listed and also assign a unique "ticker" to identify the stock (like AAPL is ticker for Apple)


##########
# Markets
##########

## Auction Market
- market in which the buyers compete on buying prices and sellers compete on selling prices simultaneously
- there is an array of bids and offers and only the best bid and offer match and trade
- the seller does not decides the price beforehand -
  this is different than a stock market where there are predefined prices of stock by sellers and buyers can just buy at that price

## Stock Market
- secondary market in which shares of publicly traded companies are issued and traded
- just like a grocery store or a fish market

## Stock Exchange
- where market participants can trade stocks with one another
- US stock exchanges: NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX

# example of checking exchange for an Apple stock
- Go to https://www.investing.com/ and search for Apple
- it will show exchange as Stock - NASDAQ


##########
# Brokers
##########
- firm that facilitates in the execution of a financial transaction for a fee
- Buttonwood Agreement - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttonwood_Agreement

# example of buying a GE stock (retro way)
- I am in Montreal and I want to buy 20 GE stocks at 80 dollars each
- I call my broker in Montreal on phone
- Montreal broker calls his Floor trader (broker) sitting in NYSE
- Floor trader on NYSE start screaming on the trading pit - 20 GE stocks to buy at 80 dollars

modern way =>
- open a trading account with broker, ex: Interactive Brokers, Alpaca etc
- buy and sell using computer via api provided by broker
- orders go to the exchange order book for GE in bid and offer
- broker provide the trading screen where the order status is displayed

# Financial Statements
#######################
- Public companies are obliged to release financial statements on a quarterly basis.
- These statements are:
  - Balance Sheet
  - Income Statement
  - Cash Flow Statement


## Balance Sheet
- reports on the company's assets, liability and owner's equity
- also has a section for management discussions and analysis

Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Equity = Assets - Liabilities

- Equity is the money from all the shareholders who have bought the stock
- Liabilities is the loan or the debt which company owns
example:
Suppose I own a house of 10M, but I took a loan from the bank initially of 6M
Then my net worth (or Equity) = 10M - 6M = 4M
Which means that if I sell the house now, I have net worth or profit of 4M

- for US stocks: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html


## Income Statement
- reports on the company's financial performance and earnings are disclosed
- this form will show the company's revenues, expenses and net profits
- also called earning statement
- normally the statement will have Total Revenues (sales, interest revenues, etc) and Total Expenses (salaries, rent, tax, ad costs, insurance, etc)
- Net Profit = Total Revenues - Total Expenses


## Cash Flow Statement
- reports on the company's cash flow - cash entering the company and cash exiting the company
- Cash flow is divided into 3 parts:
  - Core Operations
  - Investing
  - Financing
