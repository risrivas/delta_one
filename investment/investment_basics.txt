# Why Invest ?
###############

- Grow wealth

- Retire early (replace salary with profits)
- Retire with more money
- example:
If invest 15% of income every year on an index fund (say S&P 500 index),
the profits are much more than 40 years of work and salary saved!

- To make a big purchase: buy house, car, wedding, travel the world, etc



#############################
## Fundamentals of investing
#############################

############
# Inflation
############
- general rise in price level relative to available goods
example:
a pizza which was 5 dollars 6 years back will cost 10 dollars today

- each country has yearly some %age of inflation rate
example:
USA and Canada has around 2% of inflation rate per year

- Inflation is measured using the CPI (Consumer Price Index) which tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services each year

# Effects of Inflation
- if cash is saved in "tijori" for a long perod of time - it will lose it value as per the inflation rate per year
- now everyone gets salary in bank accounts - ensure that the interest rate provided by bank per year is greater than inflation rate
- same goes with salary, rents, etc - if dont get salary hike atleast equal to inflation rate or any bonus - find another job :)


##############
# Compounding
##############
- reinvest the interest to the principal in the next period

- example:
Principal = 10K
Rate = 10% p.a.
Period = 10 years

# Simple interest
every year get 1K interest and enjoy with it (not reinvest to Principal)
Simple interest profit after 10 years = P * R * T
= 10K * 0.1 * 10
= 10K

# Compound interest
every year get 1K interest and reinvest to Principal
Compound interest profit after 10 years = P * (1 + R) ^ T
= 10K (1 + 0.1) ^ 10
= 25,937.424601

# Stocks
##########

# Private Corporations
- company whose shares are not traded publicly
- owned by a small group of people - owners, employees, friends, family and qualified investors

# Stock or Shares
- investment that represents part ownership in a corporation
- when we buy shares in a company, we own proportionally part of that company


# example of starting a private corporation
- Suppose a young computer student geek named Rob has learnt how to make drones.
- He makes some drones in his home / garage and sells it to few friends.
- He makes more and more drones and sells to more people.
- Doing so for a year, he made 100K dollars in a year and has become popular.
- Now he can start his own company with 100% ownserhip - Super Drones.
- Benefits: will save tax, anyone wants to sue for bad drone - can only sue the company (not Rob individually) which will lead to some fines etc.
- Many more people want to buy drones from Super Drones and now it becomes unmanageable for Rob to handle it alone.
- He decides to open a big store with few employees like salesman, security, accountants etc.
- He needs 2M dollars to open such a big store.
- He hires a professional (accountant or lawyer) to evaluate number of shares to issue and price for each share
- Suppose the total number of shares comes out to be 100K and the price of each share is 2M/50K = 40 dollars
- Then he can sell 50% ownership (50K shares) of Super Drones to = family, friends, qualified investors.
- Other 50K shares are held by Rob.
- He gets 2M dollars and opens the store and gets employees as planned.
- The company makes profit of 1M dollars in 1 year.
- Rob gets 500K dollars of the profit.

=> going public

- Rob and his private investors (family, friends, qualified investors) now want to spread the business to other cities across the nation.
- Total budget to open stores and hire employees is 200M
- Rob needs to do IPO (initial public offering) and go public
- A public company needs to get audited every 3 months - to ensure that whatever financials / incomes they are reporting is correct
and their share prices truly reflect their incomes
- He needs to contact an underwriting firm (usually an investment bank)
- Underwriting firm will evaluate the financial statements and everything else (analysis) and come up with % breakdown of shares
- They suggest few things after all the analysis:
  - 70% of the shares to public, 15% to Rob and remaining 15% to other private investors (initial shareholders when company was private)
  - To raise 200M, they also mention stock splits and raise from 100K to 10M shares, 7M to public, remaining 1.5M each to Rob and private shareholders
  - Cost of each share = 200M/7M = 28.57 dollars
  - Float (shares available to trade for public) = 7M

this is "primary" market =>
- Underwriting firms have good contacts with big firms, institutional investors and they convince them to buy 7M shares

this is "secondary" market =>
- After a specific date, they will sell the shares in the secondary market where all public can trade
- Underwriting firm will find the exchange where company will be listed and also assign a unique "ticker" to identify the stock (like AAPL is ticker for Apple)


##########
# Markets
##########

## Auction Market
- market in which the buyers compete on buying prices and sellers compete on selling prices simultaneously
- there is an array of bids and offers and only the best bid and offer match and trade
- the seller does not decides the price beforehand -
  this is different than a stock market where there are predefined prices of stock by sellers and buyers can just buy at that price

## Stock Market
- secondary market in which shares of publicly traded companies are issued and traded
- just like a grocery store or a fish market

## Stock Exchange
- where market participants can trade stocks with one another
- US stock exchanges: NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX

# example of checking exchange for an Apple stock
- Go to https://www.investing.com/ and search for Apple
- it will show exchange as Stock - NASDAQ


##########
# Brokers
##########
- firm that facilitates in the execution of a financial transaction for a fee
- Buttonwood Agreement - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buttonwood_Agreement

# example of buying a GE stock (retro way)
- I am in Montreal and I want to buy 20 GE stocks at 80 dollars each
- I call my broker in Montreal on phone
- Montreal broker calls his Floor trader (broker) sitting in NYSE
- Floor trader on NYSE start screaming on the trading pit - 20 GE stocks to buy at 80 dollars

modern way =>
- open a trading account with broker, ex: Interactive Brokers, ICICI Demat, Alpaca etc
- buy and sell using computer via api provided by broker
- orders go to the exchange order book for GE in bid and offer
- broker provide the trading screen where the order status is displayed


###############################
# Orders, Prices and Quotation
###############################
- starting with same example
Rob - Super Drones
Ticker: SDR
IPO: 28.57$
Shares outstanding (float): 7M
Exchange: NASDAQ

- Say SDR is starting to trade on 5/Sep

#######################
# Financial Statements
#######################
- Public companies are obliged to release financial statements on a quarterly basis.
- These statements are:
  - Balance Sheet
  - Income Statement
  - Cash Flow Statement


## Balance Sheet
- reports on the company's assets, liability and owner's equity
- also has a section for management discussions and analysis

Assets = Liabilities + Equity
Equity = Assets - Liabilities

- Equity is the money from all the shareholders who have bought the stock
- Liabilities is the loan or the debt which company owns
example:
Suppose I own a house of 10M, but I took a loan from the bank initially of 6M
Then my net worth (or Equity) = 10M - 6M = 4M
Which means that if I sell the house now, I have net worth or profit of 4M

- for US stocks: https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html


## Income Statement
- reports on the company's financial performance and earnings are disclosed
- this form will show the company's revenues, expenses and net profits
- also called earning statement
- normally the statement will have Total Revenues (sales, interest revenues, etc) and Total Expenses (salaries, rent, tax, ad costs, insurance, etc)
- Net Profit = Total Revenues - Total Expenses


## Cash Flow Statement
- reports on the company's cash flow - cash entering the company and cash exiting the company
- Cash flow is divided into 3 parts:
  - Core Operations
  - Investing
  - Financing


###########
# Earnings
###########
- Earnings (E) = net profit made by a company in a period
- Earnings Per Share (EPS) = earnings made in a period divided by the number of shares outstanding
- Price to Earnings (PE) = ratio of the company's share price divided by the company's Earnings Per Share

- EPS tells how much each share's allocation of the total earnings.
- PE tells how much you are paying for each dollar of earnings the company makes. It's used to see if a company is overvalued or undervalued.

example:
- E for company 1 = 1M, shares outstanding = 200K, current share price = 500$
- E for company 2 = 2M, shares outstanding = 1M, current share price = 40$
- EPS for company 1 = 1M / 200K = 5 dollars
- EPS for company 2 = 2M / 1M = 2 dollars
- PE for company 1 = 500 / 5 = 100
- PE for company 2 = 40 / 2 = 20

- so its better to buy the shares of company 2 as PE is lower
- however, there are 2 approaches of investments here based on PE ratio:

## Growth companies
- companies that are not generating as much income relative to their price (high PE), but are expected to have high earnings growth in the future
- these companies usually have a high PE ratio, high PB ratio (price-to-book) and do not give out dividends
- example - TESLA

## Value companies
- companies that are mature and generating good income relative to their price
- not expected to grow their income much in the future
- have a low PE ratio, low PB ratio and give out dividends
- example - WALMART

- Warren Buffet has been known investing in only Value companies


#############
# Book value
#############
- value of a business according to its books (accounts) that is reflected through its financial statements
- represents the total amount a company is worth if all its assets are sold and all the liabilities are paid back

- example:
go to a company, fire all its employees, sell all the building, equipments, everything and pay all its debt
money left is book value

## Book Value per Share (BVPS)
- ratio tells the book value of a company on a per share basis
- calculated by dividing the Company's book value by its number of outstanding shares

## Price-to-Book (P/B)
- ratio compares the price of the stock to the BVPS
- calculated by dividing the company's stock price by its BVPS
- tells us how much we are paying for each dollar of book value


############
# Dividends
############
- distribution of profits by a corporation to its shareholders
- when a corporation earns a profit or surplus, it is able to pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders
- any amount not distributed is taken to be re-invested in the business
- Dividend amount = amount of money paid per share

- there are companies who pay mostly quarterly, monthly (rare), yearly or no dividends
https://www.dividend.com/

## Declaration date
- date when the company declares that they will pay a dividend and the dividend amount too

## Record date
- company records the names of all shareholders who are eligible and will receive dividend at the end of this day

## Ex-dividend date
- if buy the share on this date or after - will NOT receive the dividend
- in US, stock settlement is T+2 -
meaning it takes 2 business days after the stock is bought on exchange
and when the name of stock holder actually comes in stock certificate

- thus, ex-dividend date is one date BEFORE the record date
- in other words, stock needs to be bought on exchange atleast 2 days before record date to receive dividends

- mostly, the next day after ex-dividend date, stock prices goes down by dividend amount
example:
stock price on 11th = 10$
ex-dividend date = 12th
dividend to be paid = 1$
stock price on 13th = 9$

## Dividend yield
- annual dividends paid divided by the current market price
- tells us how much the dividends are in %age
- as a shareholder, you look for higher dividend yields


-----------------

## Technical Analysis
- study of charts (price and volume) to predict future price movement

## Fundamental Analysis
- analysis of everything that can impact the financial health of the company:
earnings, competitors, economy, interest rates, employment, laws, etc

- long-term investors (common public) use fundamental anaylsis
- traders, speculators, hedgers use technical analysis

######################
# Investment Vehicles
######################
- Underlying Assets (buy/sell the products directly)
- Mutual Funds - managed by a mutual fund manager
- Index Funds - tracking an index
- ETFs - managed by ETF companies


##########
# Indexes
##########
- correct word is indices
- tracks a value using a formula
- example - track the home expenses, unemployment rate, etc

- market index: track the market-cap OR prices of largest companies in stock market
- there is a good correlation (almost 97%) between the country's GDP and stock market index of that country

# The Dow Jones Industrial Average aka "The Dow"
- started in 1896
- incorporates 30 companies
- price weighted (not a good formula)
- ticker: DJI

# Standard and Poor's 500 Index - S&P 500 Index
- based on the market cap of the 500 largest companies
- market-cap weighted
- ticker: SPX
- represents the performance of the US stock market

- while checking in trading view for a ticker, better to use log returns chart as it will give percentage change


#############
# Index Fund
#############
- funds that seek to replicate the performance of an index they are replicating
- example:
  - suppose 10 investors invest 10K dollars each - total 100K in an index fund tracking SPX
  - fund manager will invest 100K exactly in same proportion as the market cap of each company forming the index
  - so, say Apple is having 2.5% market cap in SPX = total 2.5K dollars will be invested in Apple stocks
  - fund manager will charge commission from each investor every year - also called as expense ratio

- largest index funds providers: Vanguard, BlackRock
https://advisors.vanguard.com/investments/mutual-funds
https://www.blackrock.com/hk/en/products/products-list#!type=all&style=All&fr=43512&view=perfNav


#######################
# Net worth projection
#######################
- excel is attached
- fill in the age, salary, investing %age etc and can see the net worth
- rule of thumb - invest at least 15% of your income


######
# ETF
######
- Exchange Traded Funds
- an investment funds that holds assets like stocks, bonds, commodities or other investment products
- can be traded on a stock exchange just like a stock

- ETF can track an index - same as an index fund
- difference is that money investment in index fund (via Vanguard / BlackRock) -> fund manager will invest the money in the pool
- for ETF - investors need to buy or sell it from stock exchange (like AMEX) same like stocks

- can see the ETF on trading view screener - filter on ETF and then add average volume column and sort
https://www.tradingview.com/screener/

- example - SPY which tracks S&P 500 Index
- expense ratio = 0.09%
- most financial trading product in the whole world

- alternative ETF to track S&P 500 index is VOO having expense ratio of 0.03%

- we can compare index fund (SPX) with ETF (SPY) - both tracking same S&P 500 index using trading view
https://www.tradingview.com/chart/
- plot SPX as line chart
- then click on Compare and add symbol as SPY
- as expected the line charts for both are almost same


###############
# Mutual Funds
###############
- investment funds where individuals can pool in their money and have it managed by a professional (portfolio manager)
- difference between mutual fund and an index fund or ETF:
index fund or ETF replicate the market index => buy / sell stocks in the same proportion as in the index
mutual fund does not replicate the market index but it wants to beat the market => so it can put funds in variable proportions on different products

- mutual funds have higher fees than index fund / ETF
- S&P index has an average of 10% return over last 50 years
- Mutual fund manager target is to beat the market and produce more return than 10%

- can buy mutual funds via broker / bank / blackrock / vanguard etc

# open ended funds
- you can put money any time in the fund, portfolio manage will use that money to allocate in the fund
- you can take out the invested fund any time

# close ended funds
- has a fixed unit of shares available
- it does not issue new shares for individuals to add money to the fund
- individuals on the other hand can trade the shares of that fund on an exchange (just like ETF)
- site - go to fund screener and chose
https://www.cefconnect.com/


#####################
# Beating the market
#####################
- target of all the investors / fund managers is to beat the market index average returns
- how to beat the market ? or if we should even try to beat the basket
- investmenet vehicles:
if invest in direct underlying assets (stocks, bonds etc) OR mutual funds - you are trying to beat the market
if invest in index fund OR ETF - you are trying to align with the market index performance

- portfolio management:
if invest in traditional portfolios - you are passive investor
if invest in advanced portfolios with frequent rebalancing and reinvestments - you are an active investor and trying to beat the market


###########################
# Chosing a brokerage firm
###########################
- a brokerage account is required to trade on stocks / etfs
- best broker:
https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1338

- Interactive Broker has very less commissions and are insured
- also check if there is better commission rate in the local bank provided broker account
example: demat account in ICICI bank


--------------------------


#######################
# Building a Portfolio
#######################

# Diversifaction
- diversify or split your investment into multiple assets like stocks, bonds, gold, real estate etc.
- this helps to minimize risk as we are not sure to perform if invest in only single asset
- Risk => measurement of volatility of returns, normally measured using standard deviation
- normally an asset investment is preferable if it has less volatility (or less risk)
- 2 assets are correlated if their price change similarly - if one goes up, other goes up and vice versa
- building portfolio with uncorrelated assets is less risky with high returns

- Ray Dalio's Holy Grail: Diversification
 - it says to build portfolio with:
   - 15 to 20 uncorrelated return streams
   - Assets within the same sector are usually 60% correlated


# Sectors
- The Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS) defines these 11 sectors:
  - Energy
  - Materials
  - Industrials
  - Consumer Discretionary
  - Consumer Staples
  - Health Care
  - Financials
  - Information Technology
  - Communication Services
  - Utilities
  - Real Estate

- example site:
https://finviz.com/map.ashx?t=sec

- S&P 500 index has %age composition of all the above 11 sectors
- 4 business cycles = Early (rebounds), Mid (peaks), Late (moderates), Recession (contracts)
- in different cycles, some sectors may perform well and some may go down - so the portfolio must be rebalanced accordingly


# Top Down Approach
- first step is where to invest ? stock market ?
- then decide sector -> specific stocks within that sector or do an ETF on the whole sector


# Economy
- Gross domestic product (GDP) is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period
- GDP = consumption + investments + govt spendings + exports - imports

- when stock market crashes, government tries to stabilise it =>
 - fiscal policy - reduce tax rates, increase spending (new roads, schools, bridges etc)
 - monetary policy - central bank (in US, its Federal Reserve) = change interest rates + print money
   - if market is down, they can reduce interest rates in banks => then people will not keep their money in the banks and spend it (buy stocks, invest)
   - if market is down, can print more money

-----------------------------------

## Sector: Consumer Staples
- household goods that public buy for their daily needs irrespective of economuy going up or down
- like toothpaste, cosmetics, ration, grocery, alcohol etc
- consumer staples are noncyclical and thus are relatively stable
- these sectors have some ETFs like: XLP, FSTA (in USA)
- backtest the ETF XLP, useful site:
https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/

- other sites:
https://www.etf.com/
https://www.etfdb.com/
https://etfdb.com/etf/XLP/#holdings

- better to start with passive portfolio and after that slowly move to active (once have more knowledge and experience)
- if go to professional investment advisor - normally they charge fees which will affect the final returns


## Mutual Funds vs Index Funds and ETFs
- normally mutual funds are unable to beat the market in the long run:

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/01/in-one-of-the-most-volatile-markets-in-decades-active-fund-managers-underperformed-again.html

- reason of mutual fund failure is that its highly diversified, high fees, very conservative (and passive)
- diversification can preserve the money but they can not increase the money
