### Why Invest ?

# Grow wealth

# Retire
- Retire early (replace salary with profits)
- Retire with more money

example:
- If invest 15% of income every year on an index fund (say S&P 500 index),
the profits are much more than 40 years of work and salary saved!

# To make a big purchase
- Buy house, car, travel the world, etc

### Fundamentals of investing

############
# Inflation
############
- general rise in price level relative to available goods
example:
a pizza which was 5 dollars 6 years back wll cost 10 dollars today

- each country has yearly some %age of inflation rate
example:
USA and Canada has around 2% of inflation rate per year

- Inflation is measured using the CPI (Consumer Price Index) which tracks the prices of a basket of goods and services each year

# Effects of Inflation
- if cash is saved in "tijori" for a long perod of time - it will lose it value as per the inflation rate per year
- now everyone gets salary in bank accounts - ensure that the interest rate provided by bank per year is greater than inflation rate
- same goes with salary, rents, etc - if dont get salary hike atleast equal to inflation rate or any bonus - find another job :)


##############
# Compounding
##############
- reinvest the interest to the principal

- example:
Principal = 10K
Rate = 10% p.a.
Period = 10 years

- Simple interest
every year get 1K interest and enjoy with it (not reinvest to Principal)
Simple interest profit after 10 years = P * R * T
= 10K * 0.1 * 10
= 10K

- Compound interest
every year get 1K interest and reinvest to Principal
Compound interest profit after 10 years = P * (1 + R) ^ T
= 10K (1 + 0.1) ^ 10
= 25,937.424601
