Index Options
- came in 1981
- underlying is index or index future

---------------------------

## Indices
- Stock indices - index made of all stocks
- Calculating a stock index: weighted by price or capital

## Capitalization-weighted indices
- Capitalization of stock = float * spot price
- Float = no of shares outstanding (which can be traded by public)
- Total market value of index = sum (capitalization of each stock in index)
- Final index value = Total market value of index / Divisor

- example:
Stock A: price = 30, float = 175M, cap = price*float => 5250M
Stock B: price = 90, float = 50M, cap = price*float => 4500M
Stock C: price = 50, float = 100M, cap = price*float => 5000M

Total cap = 5250M + 4500M + 5000M => 14,750M
Divisor = 147.5M (random selection for the first time)
Index Value = Total Cap / Divisor = 14,750M / 147.5M => 100.0

---------

# Divisor
- Divisor is a random number that is initially used to reduce the index value to a workable number
- After initial divisor selection, subsequent changes in index value may lead to adjust divisor too
- Divisor is adjusted only when float changes but no change in price for a stock
- No change in divisor for "stock splits" as the cap for that stock will still be same

- If a company issues more stocks in a secondary offering (float increases), but the price is still same => need to adjust divisor
- example:
Stock A: price = 40, float = 175M, cap = 7000M
Stock B: price = 80, float = 50M, cap = 4000M
Stock C: price = 60, float = 100M, cap = 6000M

Total cap = 17000M
Divisor = 147.5M
Index Value = 115.25

Now suppose that stock A issues a 2M share secondary that evening, new float = 177M
Stock A: price = 40, float = 177M, new cap = 7080M

As nothing has changed in stock A price, need to adjust divisor to keep the same index value of 115.25

New divisor = New Total Cap / Old Index Value = 17080M / 115.25 => 148_194_117.6

- there are organisations for calculating and adjusting the divisor

---------

# Statistics
- percentage that a stock comprises of the index = stock's cap / total index cap
- how many shares of each stock in the index = stock's float / divisor

example:
Stock A: price = 40, float = 177M, cap = 7080M
Stock B: price = 80, float = 50M, cap = 4000M
Stock C: price = 60, float = 100M, cap = 6000M

Total cap = 17080M
Divisor = 147.5M
Index Value = 115.80

%age of Stock A = 7080M / 17080M = 41.5%
%age of Stock B = 4000M / 17080M = 23.4%
%age of Stock C = 6000M / 17080M = 35.1%

No of shares for Stock A = 177M / 147.5M = 1.20
No of shares for Stock B = 50M / 147.5M = 0.34
No of shares for Stock C = 100M / 147.5M = 0.68

-- thus if the Stock A goes up by 1 point, ie price goes up from 40 to 41
  => value of the index will go up by 1.20, ie from 115.80 to 117.0

Proof=
Stock A: price = 41, float = 177M, cap = 7257M
Stock B: price = 80, float = 50M, cap = 4000M
Stock C: price = 60, float = 100M, cap = 6000M

Total cap = 17257M
Divisor = 147.5M
Index Value = 116.99661016949152542372881355932
            ~= 117.0


-----

## Price-weighted indices
- equal number of shares of each stock
- add the prices of all the stocks -> divide the sum by the divisor to produce the index value
example:
Stock A: price = 30
Stock B: price = 90
Stock C: price = 50

Sum = 170
Divisor = 1.65843
Index value = Sum / Divisor = 102.51

- number of shares = stock's float / divisor => 1 / divisor
stock's float is always 1

- number of shares for each stock = 1 / 1.21943 (divisor) = 0.82 shares
- means that upward movement for any stock by 1 point will cause index to get up by 0.82


-----

# Sectors
- Sector means an index of stocks in which "all" the stocks are members of the same industry group
- example
computers and technology, international oils, domestic oils, gold, transportation, airlines, gaming, hotels, etc.
- most sectors comprise of between 20 and 30 stocks
- large indices are also called "broad-based" indices, and small indices as "narrow-based" indices


------

## Futures
- commodities futures contract is a standardized contract calling for the delivery of a specified qty of a certain commodity at some future time
- example: futures on grains, meats and metals
- recent years, also have futures on bonds, T-bills, currencies, etc.

- cash-based futures settles for cash and no actual commodity is deliverable
- example: futures on stock market indices

-- users of futures
speculator: to generate tremendous "leverage" with futures (meaning small margin can transact very high priced futures) or make money when stock indices price moves up
hedger: a "dealer" in underlying (stock index) and use to hedge the price risk

-- example of hedging
buy and hold strategy - when investor believes that market will go up
then a mutual fund manager buys all the stocks in the S&P 500 index and holds them

problem:
when the manager turns "bearish" (expecting market will go down), she would want to sell out her positions
however, commission costs and "slippage" are very large
and selling so many stocks will bring the market down
thus her remainder of portfolio will be devaluated before she can sell it

solution:
manager can sell S&P 500 futures against her portfolio instead of selling her stocks
this futures contract would move up or down in line with the S&P 500 index as it rises or falls
suppose she has sold enough futures contracts = dollar value of her portfolio
then, even if the market turns bearish (goes down) as she was expecting, her future contracts will make profit
if the market went up, futures will lose money - but this is what she was not expecting as she expected the market to go down (via theoretical analysis)
also, she saved heavy stock commission stocks and slippage - as futures commissions are normally very small

if she turns "bullish" again, she can buy the futures back and have her long stocks free to profit if the market rises
only 1 contract required to buy saving all the commission costs if buying all 500 stocks


## Futures trading
- example:
most heavily traded contract is e-mini futures on S&P 500 index
contract expires every 3 months - March(H), June(M), September(U), December(Z)
1-point move in the contract is worth $50
"big" S&P 500 futures contract is worth $250 per point of movement

a future trader buys 1 March e-mini S&P 500 futures contract at 401.00 index price (smallest unit of trading is 0.25 points)
Index price rises to 403.50
trader pakes profit of 2.50 points
or 2.5 * 50 = $125

# margin, limits and quotes
- Future contracts are traded on margin and are marked to market every day
- small initial margin account is created to trade large future contracts - leverage
- once the trade is initiated, every end of day, credit / debit is done on the margin account based on the gain or loss on future
- need to add in cash flow if the margin account balance is less than a maintenance margin
