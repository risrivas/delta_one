# Introduction to Index Options and Futures
############################################

Index Options
- came in 1981
- underlying is index or index future

---------------------------

## Indices
- Stock indices - index made of all stocks
- Calculating a stock index: weighted by price or capital

## Capitalization-weighted indices
- Capitalization of stock = float * spot price
- Float = no of shares outstanding (which can be traded by public)
- Total market value of index = sum (capitalization of each stock in index)
- Final index value = Total market value of index / Divisor

- example:
Stock A: price = 30, float = 175M, cap = price*float => 5250M
Stock B: price = 90, float = 50M, cap = price*float => 4500M
Stock C: price = 50, float = 100M, cap = price*float => 5000M

Total cap = 5250M + 4500M + 5000M => 14,750M
Divisor = 147.5M (random selection for the first time)
Index Value = Total Cap / Divisor = 14,750M / 147.5M => 100.0

---------

# Divisor
- Divisor is a random number that is initially used to reduce the index value to a workable number
- After initial divisor selection, subsequent changes in index value may lead to adjust divisor too
- Divisor is adjusted only when float changes but no change in price for a stock
- No change in divisor for "stock splits" as the cap for that stock will still be same

- If a company issues more stocks in a secondary offering (float increases), but the price is still same => need to adjust divisor
- example:
Stock A: price = 40, float = 175M, cap = 7000M
Stock B: price = 80, float = 50M, cap = 4000M
Stock C: price = 60, float = 100M, cap = 6000M

Total cap = 17000M
Divisor = 147.5M
Index Value = 115.25

Now suppose that stock A issues a 2M share secondary that evening, new float = 177M
Stock A: price = 40, float = 177M, new cap = 7080M

As nothing has changed in stock A price, need to adjust divisor to keep the same index value of 115.25

New divisor = New Total Cap / Old Index Value = 17080M / 115.25 => 148_194_117.6

- there are organisations for calculating and adjusting the divisor

---------

# Statistics
- percentage that a stock comprises of the index = stock's cap / total index cap
- how many shares of each stock in the index = stock's float / divisor

example:
Stock A: price = 40, float = 177M, cap = 7080M
Stock B: price = 80, float = 50M, cap = 4000M
Stock C: price = 60, float = 100M, cap = 6000M

Total cap = 17080M
Divisor = 147.5M
Index Value = 115.80

%age of Stock A = 7080M / 17080M = 41.5%
%age of Stock B = 4000M / 17080M = 23.4%
%age of Stock C = 6000M / 17080M = 35.1%

No of shares for Stock A = 177M / 147.5M = 1.20
No of shares for Stock B = 50M / 147.5M = 0.34
No of shares for Stock C = 100M / 147.5M = 0.68

-- thus if the Stock A goes up by 1 point, ie price goes up from 40 to 41
  => value of the index will go up by 1.20, ie from 115.80 to 117.0

Proof=
Stock A: price = 41, float = 177M, cap = 7257M
Stock B: price = 80, float = 50M, cap = 4000M
Stock C: price = 60, float = 100M, cap = 6000M

Total cap = 17257M
Divisor = 147.5M
Index Value = 116.99661016949152542372881355932
            ~= 117.0


-----

## Price-weighted indices
- equal number of shares of each stock
- add the prices of all the stocks -> divide the sum by the divisor to produce the index value
example:
Stock A: price = 30
Stock B: price = 90
Stock C: price = 50

Sum = 170
Divisor = 1.65843
Index value = Sum / Divisor = 102.51

- number of shares = stock's float / divisor => 1 / divisor
stock's float is always 1

- number of shares for each stock = 1 / 1.21943 (divisor) = 0.82 shares
- means that upward movement for any stock by 1 point will cause index to get up by 0.82


-----

# Sectors
- Sector means an index of stocks in which "all" the stocks are members of the same industry group
- example
computers and technology, international oils, domestic oils, gold, transportation, airlines, gaming, hotels, etc.
- most sectors comprise of between 20 and 30 stocks
- large indices are also called "broad-based" indices, and small indices as "narrow-based" indices


------

## Futures
- commodities futures contract is a standardized contract calling for the delivery of a specified qty of a certain commodity at some future time
- example: futures on grains, meats and metals
- recent years, also have futures on bonds, T-bills, currencies, etc.

- cash-based futures settles for cash and no actual commodity is deliverable
- example: futures on stock market indices

-- users of futures
speculator: to generate tremendous "leverage" with futures (meaning small margin can transact very high priced futures) or make money when stock indices price moves up
hedger: a "dealer" in underlying (stock index) and use to hedge the price risk

-- example of hedging
buy and hold strategy - when investor believes that market will go up
then a mutual fund manager buys all the stocks in the S&P 500 index and holds them

problem:
when the manager turns "bearish" (expecting market will go down), she would want to sell out her positions
however, commission costs and "slippage" are very large
and selling so many stocks will bring the market down
thus her remainder of portfolio will be devaluated before she can sell it

solution:
manager can sell S&P 500 futures against her portfolio instead of selling her stocks
this futures contract would move up or down in line with the S&P 500 index as it rises or falls
suppose she has sold enough futures contracts = dollar value of her portfolio
then, even if the market turns bearish (goes down) as she was expecting, her future contracts will make profit
if the market went up, futures will lose money - but this is what she was not expecting as she expected the market to go down (via theoretical analysis)
also, she saved heavy stock commission stocks and slippage - as futures commissions are normally very small

if she turns "bullish" again, she can buy the futures back and have her long stocks free to profit if the market rises
only 1 contract required to buy saving all the commission costs if buying all 500 stocks


## Futures trading
- example:
most heavily traded contract is e-mini futures on S&P 500 index
contract expires every 3 months - March(H), June(M), September(U), December(Z)
1-point move in the contract is worth $50
"big" S&P 500 futures contract is worth $250 per point of movement

a future trader buys 1 March e-mini S&P 500 futures contract at 401.00 index price (smallest unit of trading is 0.25 points)
Index price rises to 403.50
trader pakes profit of 2.50 points
or 2.5 * 50 = $125

# margin, limits and quotes
- Future contracts are traded on margin and are marked to market every day
- small initial margin account is created to trade large future contracts - leverage
- once the trade is initiated, every end of day, credit / debit is done on the margin account based on the gain or loss on future
- need to add in cash flow if the margin account balance is less than a maintenance margin

# Stock Index Hedging Strategies
#################################

## Market Baskets
- basic strategy:
buy stocks whose performance simulates the performance of an index
hedge by selling the 'overpriced' futures or options based on that index

- group of stocks that is purchased in knows as "market basket" or "cash basket" of stocks
- example:
S&P index is at 405
Futures on index at 408
Premium = 3
now strategy lies on relationship between premium and "fair value" of futures

## Futures Fair Value
- Basic formula = Current cost of underlying + (interest rate or debits) - (benefits or credits)
- In terms of future index:
Futures Fair value = [Index * (1 + (Time * (Rate - Yield)))] - Dividends

Index = current value of index
Rate = current carrying cost rate or broker loan rate
       OR, current interest rate that would be paid to a broker to buy all the stocks in the index
Yield = combined annual yield of all the stocks in the index
       OR, Net Realized Return / Principal amount
Time = time in years "remaining" until expiration of future contract
Dividends = total dividends paid on all the stocks of index until expiration of future contract - expressed in terms of points on the index

- example 1 (no dividends)
S&P 500 index is trading at 160
Borker loan rate is 10%
Yield on 500 stocks is 5%
Time remaining for futures expiry = 3 months

Time = 3 months / 12 months = 0.25 years

Futures fair value = 160 * (1 + 0.25 * (0.10 - 0.05)) - 0
                   = 160 * (1 + 0.0125) = 162

Thus, the futures contract should be having a premium of 2 (theoretically)

- premium of 2 means that there is a saving to buy future contract instead of buying all 500 stocks and pay all the commissions and carry cost
- future fair value is a function of 4 things:
  - value of the index
  - time remaining until expiration
  - current carrying rate
  - dividends being paid by the stocks in the index until expiration

# Dividends have an inverse correlation to the premium value
- futures holders do not get the dividends
- if dividends are considered, then can remove Yield from fair value calculation
- need to know the dividend amount and the ex-dividend dates of each of the stocks in the index


- example 2 (with dividends)
S&P 500 index is trading at 160
Borker loan rate is 10%
Dividends remaining until expiration = 1.89
Time remaining for futures expiry = 3 months
Time = 3 months / 12 months = 0.25 years

Futures fair value = 160 * (1 + 0.25 * 0.10) - 1.89
                   = 160 * 1.025 - 1.89 = 162.11


## Calculation of dividends
- get each stocks dividend amount + payment date
- compute the present worth of each dividend and multiply that result by that stock's divisor (float / index divisor) in the index to get the dividend weight
- index's total dividend is the sum of each of each of these individual stock computations (above step)

- example:
Suppose an index has 3 stocks:

Stock | Dividend Amt | Days until Dividend payout | Float
----------------------------------------------------------
AAA   | 1.00         | 35                         | 50M
BBB   | 0.25         | 60                         | 35M
CCC   | 0.60         |  8                         | 120M

Divisor of the index = 150M

Formula for Present Value = Future Value / (1 + Rate) ^ Time
Suppose current interest rate = 10%

Present value of AAA's dividend = 1.00 / (1 + 0.10) ^ (35/360)
                                = 0.9908

- present value of the dividend is always less than the actual dividend
- Similarly, PV of dividends of BBB and CCC are 0.2461 and 0.5987 respectively

Adjusted value of AAA's dividend = 0.9908 * 50M / 150M
                                 = 0.3303

- Similarly, Adjusted values of BBB and CCC's dividends are 0.574 and 0.4790 respectively
- Total Dividends to be used in Fair value calculation = 0.3303 + 0.574 + 0.4790
                                                       = $0.8667
- if it was a price-weighted index and not cap-weighted, then total dividends = (0.9908 + 0.2461 + 0.5987) / Divisor of Index

# Program Trading
##################
- Program Trading is trading futures against a general stock portfolio
- Index Arbitrage is trading futures against the exact stocks that comprise an index (and in same proportion)
- One reason why an investor who owned stocks would want to sell index products against them is:
she has turned bearish (market may go down) and would prefer to sell index futures rather than selling stocks
because, commission charges are quite small on futures transactions as compared to an equal dollar amount of stock
- what is left over after selling the index futures is the "tracking error"

# Tracking error
- discrepancy between the movement of the general stock market (index) and any individual portfolio

# Removing the market risk from a portfolio
- Beta = measure of the correlation of a stock's performance to that of the stock market
         OR, how the stock's movement relates to the market's as a whole

- short-term Beta is difficult to get, thus need to calculate approximate beta by comparing stock's volatility with market's volatility
- short-term beta approx is also called adjusted volatility
- example:
XYZ is volatile stock, both implied and hist volatility of 36%
Overall market volatility = 15%
Approx Beta = 36/15 = 2.40

# Portfolio Hedge
- non-volatile stocks in portfolio => sell less futures and vice versa
- portfolio vol > market vol => then sell more futures
- in other words, if one does not sell enough futures against a volatile portfolio, then there is risk of loss if the market declines
as the portfolio will decline faster than the market

# Steps to determine how many futures to sell against a diverse portfolio of stocks:
1) Divide each stock's volatility by the market's (S&P 500 index) volatility => this is stock's adjusted volatility
2) Adjusted capitalization of the stock in portfolio = Qty of stock * price * adjusted volatility (from step 1)
3) Sum the adjusted cap of each stock in the portfolio
4) Divide the sum by the index price of the futures by the unit of trading for the futures ($250 per point for S&P 500 futures) => no of futures to sell

- example:
Suppose one owns a portfolio of very diversified 3 stocks (OTC tech, utility, oil)
Owner becomes bearish and want to sell futures to hedge -> how many futures to sell?
Market index volatility = 15%
Index price = 178.65
Unit of trading = $500 (per point move)

Stock | Volatility | Adjusted Vol (Step 1) | Price | Quantity | Adjusted Cap (Step 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GOGO  | 0.60       | 0.60/0.15 = 4.00      | 25    | 3000     | 3K*25*4.00 = $300K
UTIL  | 0.12       | 0.12/0.15 = 0.80      | 60    | 5000     | 5K*60*0.80 = $240K
OIL   | 0.30       | 0.30/0.15 = 2.00      | 45    | 2000     | 2K*45*2.00 = $180K
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                                                                Total = $720K (Step 3)

Step 4 = $720K / (500 * 178.65) = 8.06

=> total 8 futures to sell

- total cap in above example: 3K*25 + 5K*60 + 2K*45 = $465K
- however, as it has volatile stocks, need to hedge $720K worth of "market" to compensate for the higher volatility

- always use price of index in all hedging calculations (how many stocks to buy or how many futures to sell) rather than price of future
- notice that this example is state with this precondition:
Owner becomes bearish and want to sell "overpriced" futures to hedge


-------------------------------------------

##################
# Index Arbitrage
##################
- IA consists of buying virtually all of the stocks in an index (same proportion) and selling futures against them, or vice-versa
- when futures are over-priced (market price > fair value): buy stocks, sell futures
- when futures are under-priced (market price < fair value): sell (or short-sell) stocks, buy futures
- arbitrage profit = fair value of futures - buy/sell price of stocks

- trader should determine how many shares of each stock she will buy / sell to duplicate the index
- in a price-weighted index, buy/sell the same no of shares of each stock
- in a cap-weighted index, different numbers of shares of each stock


## how many shares to buy
- find total dollar amount of futures contract
- example:
suppose trader wants to sell 50 XYZ futures contract
how many stocks to buy against these 50 contracts ?
UOT (Unit of Trading) = $500 per point
Index is trading at 168.89

Total dollar amount of 50 futures = 50 * 500 * 168.89 = $422,225
Hedger should buy this much dollar amount stock to hedge 50 futures contract sold

# in a "price-weighted" index,
no of shares to buy by determining the total dollar value of the index and divide by the index divisor

- example:
Suppose a price weighted index which has 3 stocks
A = $30; B = $90; C = $50
Price total = $170
Index Divisor = 1.65843
Index Value = 102.51

No of shares of each stock in the index = 1 / 1.65843 = 0.60298 shares
Thus, if we were to buy 0.60298 shares of each of the 3 stocks, we would have creted the index

Now, suppose the futures on this index is $250 per point
=> no of shares to buy to hedge 1 futures contract =  0.60298 * 1 * 250 = 150.745 shares of each stock

for 100 futures contracts, no of shares to buy = 0.60298 * 100 * 250 = 15074.5 shares of each stock
=> so buy 15100 shares of each stock and on every 4th round - buy 15000 shares to avoid odd lots


# in a "cap-weighted" index,
- formula is same as price-weighted index

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Shares of stock N to buy = Shares of N in index * Futures qty * Futures UOT |
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Shares of N in index = float of N / Index divisor
- example:

index value = 115.80
Divisor = 147.5M

Stock | Price | Float | Capitalization | Shares
---------------------------------------------------------------
A     | 40    | 177M  | 7080M          | 177M / 147.5M = 1.20
B     | 80    | 50M   | 4000M          | 50M / 147.5M = 0.34
C     | 60    | 100M  | 6000M          | 100M / 147.5M = 0.68
---------------------------------------------------------------
                       Total = 17080M

- so buy 1.20 shares of A, 0.34 shares of B and 0.68 C shares, trader will duplicate the index
- suppose Futures UOT on this index = $500

- if want to sell 5 futures at a time,
no of A shares to buy = 1.20 * 5 * 500 = 3000; dollar amount = 3000 * 40 = $120K
no of B shares to buy = 0.34 * 5 * 500 = 850; dollar amount = 850 * 80 = $68K
no of C shares to buy = 0.68 * 5 * 500 = 1700; dollar amount = 1700 * 60 = $102K

total = $290K worth of stocks to buy

- dollar amount of futures = 5 * 500 * 115.80 = $289.5K
- this is close to $290K as calculated above
